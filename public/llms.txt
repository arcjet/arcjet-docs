# Arcjet

Arcjet is an SDK to help developers protect their applications from security
threats. It provides features like bot protection, rate limiting, WAF, email
validation, signup form protection, and sensitive information detection &
redaction. These can be integrated into applications with just a few lines of
code.

## Docs

A quick start guide is available to show how to configure Arcjet rules to
protect your app from attacks, apply a rate limit, and prevent bots from
accessing your app for the following frameworks.

## Next.js example

This example will protect a Next.js API route with a rate limit, bot detection,
and Shield WAF.

### 1. Installation

```shell
npm i @arcjet/next
```

For production, store the key securely using environment variables provided by
your hosting platform to avoid exposing it in source control.

### 2. Set your key

[Create a free Arcjet account](https://app.arcjet.com) then follow the
instructions to add a site and get a key.

Add your key to a `.env.local` file in your project root.

```ini
ARCJET_KEY=ajkey_yourkey
```

### 3. Add rules

Create a new API route at `/app/api/arcjet/route.ts`:

```ts
import arcjet, {
  type ArcjetRuleResult,
  detectBot,
  shield,
  tokenBucket,
} from "@arcjet/next";
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";

const aj = arcjet({
  key: process.env.ARCJET_KEY!,
  rules: [
    // Shield protects your app from common attacks e.g. SQL injection
    shield({ mode: "LIVE" }),
    // Create a bot detection rule
    detectBot({
      mode: "LIVE", // Blocks requests. Use "DRY_RUN" to log only
      // Block all bots except the following
      allow: [
        "CATEGORY:SEARCH_ENGINE", // Google, Bing, etc
        // Uncomment to allow these other common bot categories
        // See the full list at https://arcjet.com/bot-list
        //"CATEGORY:MONITOR", // Uptime monitoring services
        //"CATEGORY:PREVIEW", // Link previews e.g. Slack, Discord
      ],
    }),
    // Create a token bucket rate limit. Other algorithms are supported.
    tokenBucket({
      mode: "LIVE",
      refillRate: 5, // Refill 5 tokens per interval
      interval: 10, // Refill every 10 seconds
      capacity: 10, // Bucket capacity of 10 tokens
    }),
  ],
});

export async function GET(req: Request) {
  // Deduct 5 tokens from the bucket for this request
  const decision = await aj.protect(req, { requested: 5 });
  console.log("Arcjet decision", decision);

  if (decision.isDenied()) {
    if (decision.reason.isRateLimit()) {
      return NextResponse.json(
        { error: "Too Many Requests", reason: decision.reason },
        { status: 429 },
      );
    } else if (decision.reason.isBot()) {
      return NextResponse.json(
        { error: "No bots allowed", reason: decision.reason },
        { status: 403 },
      );
    } else {
      return NextResponse.json(
        { error: "Forbidden", reason: decision.reason },
        { status: 403 },
      );
    }
  }

  return NextResponse.json({ message: "Hello world" });
}
```

The `{ requested: 5 }` option specifies that this request consumes 5 tokens from
the rate limit bucket. Adjust this value based on the "cost" of each request.

Calls to `protect()` only require additional options when the rule requires
additional information. For example, the token bucket rate limit rule requires
the number of tokens to consume.

### 4. Start your app

```shell
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000/api/arcjet` in your browser and refresh a few times
to hit the rate limit.

Wait 10 seconds, then run:

```shell
curl -v http://localhost:3000/api/arcjet
```

The wait is necessary because the decision is cached for your IP based on the
`interval` rate limit configuration.

You should see a `403` response because `curl` is considered a bot by default
([customizable](https://docs.arcjet.com/bot-protection/identifying-bots)).

The requests will also show in the [Arcjet dashboard](https://app.arcjet.com).

## Product philosophy

1. Proper security protections need the full context of the application, which
is why security rules and protections should be located alongside the code they
are protecting.

2. Security rules should be easy to test. You should be able to run them in
development as well as production.

3. Arcjet should not interfere with the rest of the application. It should be
easy to install, must not add significant latency to requests, and should not
require changes to the application’s architecture.

## Important notes

- Arcjet runs server-side and does not require any client-side integration.

- Arcjet is a paid service, but it offers a free tier with limited features.
Free tier users do not get access to more advanced bot detection, have limited
IP analysis data (country only), and cannot use the email validation or
sensitive information detection features. See https://arcjet.com/pricing for
details.

- Arcjet currently supports JS with SDKs for Astro, Bun, Deno, Fastify, NestJS,
Next.js, Node.js, Nuxt, React Router, Remix, and SvelteKit.

## Tips

- We recommend creating a single instance of the Arcjet object and reusing it
throughout your application. This is because the SDK caches decisions and
configuration to improve performance. The pattern we use is to create a utility
file that exports the Arcjet object and then import it where you need it, using
`withRule` to attach rules specific to each route or location in your app. See
our example Next.js app for how this is done:
https://github.com/arcjet/example-nextjs/blob/main/lib/arcjet.ts 

- Create the Arcjet object outside of the route handler to avoid creating a new
instance on every request. `protect()` should be called inside the route handler.

- We do not recommend using Arcjet in middleware. This is because middleware
lacks the context of the route handler, making it difficult to apply
route-specific rules or customize responses based on the request. Our
recommendation is to call `protect()` in each route handler where you need it.
This offers most flexibility and allows you to customize the behavior for each
route.

- The Arcjet `protect()` function should be called only once per request. Pay
attention when implementing Arcjet in middleware and in route handlers to ensure
that the function is not called multiple times. Use a middleware helper or check
the matcher config to ensure that Arcjet in middleware does not get called as
well as in the route handler. Next.js renamed `middleware.js` to `proxy.js` in
Next.js 16.

- Each rule can be configured in either `LIVE` or `DRY_RUN` mode. When in
`DRY_RUN` mode, each rule will return its decision, but the end conclusion will
always be `ALLOW`. This is useful for testing. As these are configured in code,
you can use other mechanisms to set the mode. For example, you could could use
an existing feature flag system to dynamically change the rule mode.

- Rule Evaluation: Arcjet evaluates all rules and combines their decisions. If
any rule results in a `DENY` (e.g., rate limit exceeded or bot detected), the
request is denied with the most relevant reason. However, you can inspect the
results of each rule to determine the reason for the denial. For example:

```ts
const decision = await aj.protect(req);

if (decision.isDenied()) {
  if (decision.reason.isRateLimit()) {
    console.error("Rate limit exceeded", decision.reason);
  } else if (decision.reason.isBot()) {
    console.error("Bot detected", decision.reason);
  } else {
    // Ensure all cases are handled
    console.error("Forbidden", decision.reason);
  }
}
```

- Calls to `protect()` will not throw an error. Arcjet is designed to fail open
so that a service issue or misconfiguration does not block all requests. If
there is an error condition when processing the rule, Arcjet will return an
`ERROR` result for that rule and you can check the message property on the
rule’s error result for more information. For example:

```ts
const decision = await aj.protect(req);

if (decision.isErrored()) {
  // Fail open: log the error and allow the request
  console.error("Arcjet error", decision.reason.message);
}
```

- Arcjet needs to see the original client IP address to make accurate decisions.
If your application is behind a proxy or load balancer, you need to ensure that
Arcjet can access the original IP address. This is not necessary on platforms
like Firebase, Netlify, Fly.io, or Vercel because Arcjet can auto-detect the
proxy IPs for these platforms. For other platforms, the load balancer or proxy
IP or IP range should be configured in the Arcjet client `proxies` option. For
example:

```ts
const aj = arcjet({
  key: process.env.ARCJET_KEY!,
  rules: [],
  proxies: [
    "100.100.100.100", // A single IP
    "100.100.100.0/24", // A CIDR for the range
  ],
});
```
