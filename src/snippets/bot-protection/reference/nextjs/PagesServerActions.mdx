## Pages & Server Actions

Arcjet can be used inside Next.js middleware, API routes, pages, server
components, and server actions. Client components cannot be protected because
they run on the client only.

See the [Next.js SDK reference](/reference/nextjs) for examples of [pages / page
components](/reference/nextjs#pages--page-components) and [server
actions](/reference/nextjs#server-actions).
