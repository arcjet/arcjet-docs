  This will run on every request to your Next.js app, except for static assets
(configured in the `matcher` - see [the Next.js
docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/middleware#matcher)
for details).

  <div slot="TS" slotIdx="1">
    Create a file called `middleware.ts` in your project root (at the same level as
`pages` or `app` or inside `src`):

<Code
  code={MiddlewareTS}
  lang="ts"
  title="/middleware.ts"
  mark={["ARCJET_KEY"]}
/>

You can also customize the response depending on the decision. In this case we
will return a 403 Forbidden response only if we detect a hosting provider IP
address for the bot detection rule result:

<Code code={CustomizedMiddlewareTS} lang="ts" title="/middleware.ts" />
  </div>
  <div slot="JS" slotIdx="2">
    Create a file called `middleware.js` in your project root (at the same level as
`pages` or `app` or inside `src`):

<Code
  code={MiddlewareJS}
  lang="js"
  title="/middleware.js"
  mark={["ARCJET_KEY"]}
/>

You can also customize the response depending on the decision. In this case we

### Avoiding double protection with middleware

If you use Arcjet in middleware and individual routes, you need to be careful
that Arcjet is not running multiple times per request. This can be avoided by
excluding the API route from [the middleware
matcher](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/middleware#matcher).

For example, if you already have a bot detection rule defined in the API route
at `/api/hello`, you can exclude it from the middleware by specifying a matcher
in `/middleware.ts`:

<Code code={MiddlewareMatcher} lang="ts" title="/middleware.ts" />
