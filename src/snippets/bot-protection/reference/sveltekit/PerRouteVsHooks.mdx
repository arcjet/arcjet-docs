## Per route vs hooks

Bot protection rules can be configured in two ways:

- **Per route**: The rule is defined in the route handler itself. This allows
  you to configure the rule alongside the code it is protecting which is useful
  if you want to use the decision to add context to your own code. However, it
  means rules are not located in a single place.
- **Hooks**: The rule is defined as a hook. This allows you to configure rules
  in a single place or apply them globally to all routes, but it means the rules
  are not located alongside the code they are protecting.

### Per route

This configures bot protection on a single route.

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <PerRoute slot="sveltekit" />
</SlotByFramework>

### Hooks

This will run on every request to your SvelteKit app - see
[the SvelteKit Hooks docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/hooks) for details.

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <Hooks slot="sveltekit" />
</SlotByFramework>

### Avoiding double protection with hooks

If you use Arcjet in hooks and individual routes, you need to be careful that
Arcjet is not running multiple times per request. This can be avoided by
excluding the individual routes before running Arcjet in the hook.

For example, if you already have rules defined in the API route at
`/api/arcjet`, you can exclude it from the hook like this:

<Code code={HookMatcher} lang="ts" title="/src/hooks.server.ts" />
