import SelectableContent from "@/components/SelectableContent";

### 4. Start app

Start your Astro app:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<SelectableContent client:load syncKey="packageManager">
<div slot="npm" slotIdx="1">
```sh
npm run dev
```
</div>
<div slot="pnpm" slotIdx="2">
```sh
pnpm run dev
```
</div>
<div slot="yarn" slotIdx="3">
```sh
yarn run dev
```
</div>
</SelectableContent>

Make a `curl` request from your terminal to your application. You should see a
`403 Forbidden` response because `curl` is considered an automated client by
default. See [the reference guide](/bot-protection/reference) to learn about
configuring this.

```shell
curl -I http://localhost:4321
```
