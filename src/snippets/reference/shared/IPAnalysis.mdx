As of SDK version `1.0.0-alpha.11`, the `ArcjetDecision` object contains an `ip`
property. This includes additional data about the client IP address:

#### IP location

The following are available on the <Badge text="Free" variant="caution" /> plan:

- `country` (`string | undefined`): the country code the client IP address.
- `countryName` (`string | undefined`): the country name of the client IP
  address.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
The following are available on the <Badge text="Starter" variant="note" /> and <Badge text="Business" variant="tip" /> plans:

- `latitude` (`number | undefined`): the latitude of the client IP address.
- `longitude` (`number | undefined`): the longitude of the client IP address.
- `accuracyRadius` (`number | undefined`): how accurate the location is in
  kilometers.
- `timezone` (`string | undefined`): the timezone of the client IP address.
- `postalCode` (`string | undefined`): the postal or zip code of the client IP
  address.
- `city` (`string | undefined`): the city of the client IP address.
- `region` (`string | undefined`): the region of the client IP address.
- `continent` (`string | undefined`): the continent code of the client IP
  address.
- `continentName` (`string | undefined`): the continent name of the client IP
  address.

The IP location fields may be `undefined`, but you can use various methods to
check their availability. Using the methods will also refine the type to remove
the need for null or undefined checks.

- `hasLatitude()` (`bool`): returns whether the `latitude` and `accuracyRadius`
  fields are available.
- `hasLongitude()` (`bool`): returns whether the `longitude` and
  `accuracyRadius` fields are available.
- `hasAccuracyRadius()` (`bool`): returns whether the `longitude`, `latitude`,
  and `accuracyRadius` fields are available.
- `hasTimezone()` (`bool`): returns whether the `timezone` field is available.
- `hasPostalCode()` (`bool`): returns whether the `postalCode` field is
  available.
- `hasCity()` (`bool`): returns whether the `city` field is available.
- `hasRegion()` (`bool`): returns whether the `region` field is available.
- `hasCountry()` (`bool`): returns whether the `country` and `countryName`
  fields are available.
- `hasContinent()` (`bool`): returns whether the `continent` and `continentName`
  fields are available.

##### Location accuracy

IP geolocation can be notoriously inaccurate, especially for mobile devices,
satellite internet providers, and even just normal users. Likewise with the
specific fields like `city` and `region`, which can be very inaccurate. Country
is usually accurate, but there are often cases where IP addresses are
mis-located. These fields are provided for convenience e.g. suggesting a user
location, but should not be relied upon by themselves.

#### IP AS

This is useful for identifying the network operator of the client IP address.
This is useful for understanding whether the client is likely to be automated or
not, or being stricter with requests from certain networks.

The IP AS fields may be `undefined`, but you can use the `hasASN()` method to
check their availability. Using this method will also refine the type to remove
the need for null-ish checks.

The following are available on the <Badge text="Starter" variant="note" /> and <Badge text="Business" variant="tip" /> plans:

- `hasASN()` (`bool`): returns whether all of the ASN fields are available.
- `asn` (`string | undefined`): the autonomous system (AS) number of the client
  IP address.
- `asnName` (`string | undefined`): the name of the AS of the client IP address.
- `asnDomain` (`string | undefined`): the domain of the AS of the client IP
  address.
- `asnType` (`'isp' | 'hosting' | 'business' | 'education'`): the type of the AS
  of the client IP address. Real users are more likely to be on an ISP or
  business network rather than a hosting provider. Education networks often have
  a single or small number of IP addresses even though there are many users. A
  common mistake is to block a single IP because of too many requests when it is
  a university or company network using
  [NAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-grade_NAT) (Network Address
  Translation) to give many users the same IP.
- `asnCountry` (`string | undefined`): the country code of the AS of the client
  IP address. This is the administrative country of the AS, not necessarily the
  country of the client IP address.

#### IP type

The `service` field may be `undefined`, but you can use the `hasService()`
method to check the availability. Using this method will also refine the type to
remove the need for null-ish checks.

The following are available on all pricing plans:

- `hasService()` (`bool`): whether the `service` field is available.
- `service` (`string | undefined`): the name of the service associated with the
  IP address—e.g. `Apple Private Relay`.
- `isHosting()` (`bool`): returns whether the IP address of the client is owned
  by a hosting provider. Requests originating from a hosting provider IP
  significantly increase the likelihood that this is an automated client.
- `isVpn()` (`bool`): returns whether the IP address of the client is owned by a
  VPN provider. Many people use VPNs for privacy or work purposes, so by itself
  this is not an indicator of the client being automated. However, it does
  increase the risk score of the client and depending on your use case it may be
  a characteristic you wish to restrict.
- `isProxy()` (`bool`): returns whether the IP address of the client is owned by
  a proxy provider. Similar to `isVpn()`, but proxies are more likely to involve
  automated traffic.
- `isTor()` (`bool`): returns whether the IP address of the client is known to
  be part of the Tor network. As with `isVpn()`, there are legitimate uses for
  hiding your identity through Tor, however it is also often a way to hide the
  origin of malicious traffic.
- `isRelay()` (`bool`): returns whether the IP address of the client is owned by
  a relay service. The most common example is Apple iCloud Relay, which
  indicates the client is less likely to be automated because Apple requires a
  paid subscription linked to an Apple account in good standing.
