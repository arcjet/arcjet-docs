Arcjet supports the [active and maintenance LTS
versions](https://github.com/nodejs/release) of Node.js:

- Node.js 18.x LTS
- Node.js 20.x LTS
- Node.js 22.x LTS

When a Node.js version goes end of life, we will bump the major version of the
Arcjet SDK. [Technical support](/support) is provided for the current major
version of the Arcjet SDK for all users and for the current and previous major
versions for paid users. We will provide security fixes for the current and
previous major SDK versions.
