Make a `curl` request from your terminal. You should see a `403` response
because `curl` is considered a bot by default. This [can be
customized](/bot-protection/identifying-bots).

```sh
curl -v http://localhost:5173/api/arcjet
```

Then load `http://localhost:5173/api/arcjet` in your browser. Refresh the page a
few times to trigger the rate limit. The requests will also show up in the
[Arcjet dashboard](https://app.arcjet.com).
