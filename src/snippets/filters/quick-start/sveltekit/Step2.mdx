SvelteKit loads environment variables for you in development and expects
you to define them in your hosting platform in production.
Arcjet integrations read from `ARCJET_*` environment variables.
Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your key:

```ini title=".env"
# Run in development mode; leave this unset in production.
ARCJET_ENV=development
# Get your site key at <https://app.arcjet.com>.
ARCJET_KEY=ajkey_yourkey
```
