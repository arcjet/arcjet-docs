## Per route vs hooks

Rate limit rules can be configured in two ways:

- **Per route**: The rule is defined in the route handler itself. This allows
  you to configure the rule alongside the code it is protecting which is useful
  if you want to use the decision to add context to your own code. However, it
  means rules are not located in a single place.
- **Hooks**: The rule is defined as a hook. This allows you to
  configure rules in a single place or apply them globally to all routes, but
  it means the rules are not located alongside the code they are protecting.

### Per route

If you define your rate limit within an API route Arcjet assumes that the limit
applies only to that route. If you define your rate limit in hooks, you should
use `event.url.pathname.startsWith`.

#### Rate limit only on `/api/*`

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <HookMatchingPaths slot="sveltekit" />
</SlotByFramework>

#### Rate limit on all routes

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <HookAllRoutes slot="sveltekit" />
</SlotByFramework>

### Avoiding double protection with hooks

If you use Arcjet in hooks and individual routes, you need to be careful
that Arcjet is not running multiple times per request. This can be avoided by
excluding the individual routes before running Arcjet in the hook.

For example, if you already have a rule defined in the route at `/api`, you can
exclude it from the hook like this:

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <HookMatcher slot="sveltekit" />
</SlotByFramework>
