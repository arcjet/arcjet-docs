## Per route vs middleware

Rate limit rules can be configured in two ways:

- **Route handlers**: The rule is defined in the route handler (previously known
  as an API route) itself. This allows you to configure the rule alongside the
  code it is protecting which is useful if you want to use the decision to add
  context to your own code. However, it means rules are not automatically
  applied to every request.
- **Middleware/Proxy**: The rule is defined in the middleware (renamed to proxy
  in Next.js 16). This allows you to configure rules in a single place or apply
  them globally to all routes, but it means the rules are not located alongside
  the code they are protecting and can miss route specific context .

:::note
If you use a platform that performs health checks or liveness probes, ensure
that Arcjet is not enabled for those routes. These requests will not have all
of the metadata that Arcjet requires to make security decisions.

### Per route

If you define your rate limit within an API route Arcjet assumes that the limit
applies only to that route. If you define your rate limit in middleware, you
should either use the Next.js `matcher` config to choose which paths to execute
the middleware for, or use `request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith`.

#### Rate limit only on `/api/*`

You can use conditionals in your Next.js middleware to match multiple paths.

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <MiddlewareMatchingPaths slot="next-js" />
</SlotByFramework>

#### Middleware

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <MiddlewareAllRoutes slot="next-js" />
</SlotByFramework>

### Avoiding double protection

If you use Arcjet in middleware/proxy and individual routes, you need to be
careful that Arcjet is not running multiple times per request. This can be
avoided by excluding the API route from [the middleware
matcher](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/proxy#matcher).

For example, if you already have a rate limit defined in the API route at
`/api/hello`, you can exclude it from the middleware by specifying a matcher in
`/proxy.ts`:

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <MiddlewareMatcher slot="next-js" />
</SlotByFramework>
