## Per route vs middleware

Rate limit rules can be configured in two ways:

- **Per API route**: The rule is defined in the API route itself. This allows
  you to configure the rule alongside the code it is protecting which is useful
  if you want to use the decision to add context to your own code. However, it
  means rules are not located in a single place.
- **Middleware**: The rule is defined in the middleware. This allows you to
  configure rules in a single place or apply them globally to all routes, but
  it means the rules are not located alongside the code they are protecting.

:::note
If you use a platform that performs health checks or liveness probes, ensure
that Arcjet is not enabled for those routes. These requests will not have all
of the metadata that Arcjet requires to make security decisions.

### Per route

If you define your rate limit within an API route Arcjet assumes that the limit
applies only to that route. If you define your rate limit in middleware, you
should either use the Next.js `matcher` config to choose which paths to execute
the middleware for, or use `request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith`.

#### Rate limit only on `/api/*`

You can use conditionals in your Next.js middleware to match multiple paths.

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <MiddlewareMatchingPaths slot="next-js" />
</SlotByFramework>

#### Rate limit on all routes

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <MiddlewareAllRoutes slot="next-js" />
</SlotByFramework>

### Avoiding double protection with middleware

If you use Arcjet in middleware and individual routes, you need to be careful
that Arcjet is not running multiple times per request. This can be avoided by
excluding the API route from [the middleware
matcher](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/middleware#matcher).

For example, if you already have a rate limit defined in the API route at
`/api/hello`, you can exclude it from the middleware by specifying a matcher in
`/middleware.ts`:

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <MiddlewareMatcher slot="next-js" />
</SlotByFramework>
