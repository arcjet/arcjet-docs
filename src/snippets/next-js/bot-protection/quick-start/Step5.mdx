Make a `curl` request from your terminal to your application. You should see a
`403 Forbidden` response because `curl` is considered an automated client by
default. See [the reference guide](/bot-protection/reference) to learn about
configuring this.

```shell
# Will show just the response headers, which should be 403 forbidden
curl -I http://localhost:3000
```

The requests will also show up in the [Arcjet
dashboard](https://app.arcjet.com).
