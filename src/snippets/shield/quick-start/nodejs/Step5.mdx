```sh
curl -v -H "x-arcjet-suspicious: true" http://localhost:8000
```

After the 5th request, you will see this in your logs:

```text
Rule Result ArcjetRuleResult {
   ttl: 0,
   state: 'DRY_RUN',
   conclusion: 'DENY',
   reason: ArcjetShieldReason { type: 'SHIELD', shieldTriggered: true }
}
Conclusion ALLOW
```

The final conclusion is `ALLOW` even though the rule result conclusion is
`DENY`. This is because the rule is in dry run mode. Switch it to `LIVE` mode to
actually block the request.
