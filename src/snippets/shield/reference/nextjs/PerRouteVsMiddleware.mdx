## Per route vs middleware

Shield can be configured in two ways:

- **Per API route**: The rule is defined in the API route itself. This allows
  you to configure the rule alongside the code it is protecting which is useful
  if you want to use the decision to add context to your own code. However, it
  means rules are not located in a single place.
- **Middleware**: The rule is defined in the middleware. This allows you to
  configure rules in a single place or apply them globally to all routes, but
  it means the rules are not located alongside the code they are protecting.

### Per route

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <PerRouteNextJs slot="next-js" />
</SlotByFramework>

### Middleware

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <MiddlewareNextJs slot="next-js" />
</SlotByFramework>
