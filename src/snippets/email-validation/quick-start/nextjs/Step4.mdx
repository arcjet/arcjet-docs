import SelectableContent from "@/components/SelectableContent";

### 4. Start app

Start your Next.js app:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<SelectableContent client:idle syncKey="packageManager">
<div slot="npm" slotIdx="1">
```sh
npm run dev
```
</div>
<div slot="pnpm" slotIdx="2">
```sh
pnpm run dev
```
</div>
<div slot="yarn" slotIdx="3">
```sh
yarn run dev
```
</div>
</SelectableContent>

Then load `http://localhost:3000/api/arcjet`. The email address is from a
disposable email service, so the decision is to deny. This can be adapted to API
routes in your application which accept user submissions e.g. a signup form.
