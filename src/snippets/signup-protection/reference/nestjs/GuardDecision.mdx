Arcjet can be integrated using a global [guard](https://docs.nestjs.com/guards)
or per route guards. However these can't be used for signup protection rules
because you can't access the decision to handle the form submission. Instead,
you call the `protect` function in your route handler. See
[bot protection](/bot-protection/quick-start) for an example where guards are
used.
