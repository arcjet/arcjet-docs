Arcjet only accepts non-local IP addresses with a fallback to 127.0.0.1 in
development mode. Since Bun doesn't set `NODE_ENV` for you, you also need to
set `ARCJET_ENV` in your environment file.

```ini title=".env.local"
# NODE_ENV is not set automatically, so tell Arcjet we're in dev
# You can leave this unset in prod
ARCJET_ENV=development
# Get your site key from https://app.arcjet.com
ARCJET_KEY=ajkey_yourkey
```
