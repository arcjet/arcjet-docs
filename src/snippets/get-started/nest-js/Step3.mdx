  Update your `src/main.ts` file with the contents:

  <Code code={GlobalGuard} lang="ts" title="src/main.ts" />

  This creates a global guard that will be applied to all routes. In a real
  application, implementing guards or per-route protections would give you more
  flexibility. See [our example app](https://github.com/arcjet/example-nestjs) for
  how to do this.
