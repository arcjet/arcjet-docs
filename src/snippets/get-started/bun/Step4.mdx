:::note
Bun's `--hot` flag will reload the runtime when changes are made to your `.ts`
files, but not your `.env.local` file. If you change your `.env.local` file,
you need to restart the command manually.

Visit [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) in your browser and
refresh a few times to hit the rate limit. You may see 2 requests - one for the
page and one for a favicon.

Wait 10 seconds, then run:

```sh
curl -v http://localhost:3000
```

The wait is necessary because the decision is cached for your IP based on the
`interval` rate limit configuration.

You should see a `403` response because `curl` is considered a bot by default
([customizable](/bot-protection/identifying-bots)).
