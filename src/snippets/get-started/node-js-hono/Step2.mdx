Add your key to a `.env.local` file in your project root.

```ini title=".env.local"
# NODE_ENV is not set automatically, so tell Arcjet we're in dev
# You can leave this unset in prod
ARCJET_ENV=development
# Get your site key from https://app.arcjet.com
ARCJET_KEY=ajkey_yourkey
```

:::caution[IP Address]
Arcjet only accepts non-local IP addresses with a fallback to 127.0.0.1 in
development mode. Since Node.js doesn't set `NODE_ENV` for you, you also need to
set `ARCJET_ENV` in your environment file.
:::

Next you need to update the dev command in your `package.json` to use the
`.env.local` file.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "tsx watch --env-file .env.local src/index.ts"
  }
  ...
}
```

<Aside type="note" title="env files">
  Node 20+ supports loading environment variables from a local file with
  `--env-file`. If you're using an older version of Node, you can use a package
  like [`dotenv`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) to load the environment
  variables from a `.env.local` file.
