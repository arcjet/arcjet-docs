We recommend using the [uv package manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), but you can also install [Arcjet from PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/arcjet/) using pip.

If you do not have uv installed, you can install it by following the instructions below:

macOS and Linux

```sh
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Windows

```sh
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

```

For detailed instructions refer to the [uv project](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).
