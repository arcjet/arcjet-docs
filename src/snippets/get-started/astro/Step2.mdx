The Arcjet Astro integration reads your Arcjet key from the `ARCJET_KEY`
environment variable. During development, add your key to a `.env.local` file in
your project root. Astro will automatically load the environment variables from
this file, learn more in the
[Astro docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/environment-variables/#env-files).

```ini title=".env.local"
# Get your site key from https://app.arcjet.com
