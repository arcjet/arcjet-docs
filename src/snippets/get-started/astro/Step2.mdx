The Arcjet Astro integration reads your Arcjet key from the `ARCJET_KEY`
environment variables. During development, add your key to a `.env` file
in your project root. Astro will automatically load the environment
variables from this file, learn more in the
[Astro docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/environment-variables/#env-files).
