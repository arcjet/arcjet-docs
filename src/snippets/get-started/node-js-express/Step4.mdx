<Aside type="note" title="env files">
  Node 20+ supports loading environment variables from a local file with
  `--env-file`. If you're using an older version of Node, you can use a package
  like [`dotenv`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) to load the environment
  variables from a `.env.local` file.

Visit [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) in your browser and
refresh a few times to hit the rate limit.

Wait 10 seconds, then run:

```sh
curl -v http://localhost:3000
```

The wait is necessary because the decision is cached for your IP based on the
`interval` rate limit configuration.

You should see a `403` response because `curl` is considered a bot by default
([customizable](/bot-protection/identifying-bots)).
