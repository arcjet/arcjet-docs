## 4. Start app

```shell
uv run uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Visit [`http://localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000) in your browser and
refresh a few times to hit the rate limit.

Wait 10 seconds, then run:

```sh
curl -v http://localhost:8000
```

The wait is necessary because the decision is cached for your IP based on the
`interval` rate limit configuration.

You should see a `403` response because `curl` is considered a bot by default
([customizable](/bot-protection/identifying-bots)).
