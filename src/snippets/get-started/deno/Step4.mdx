## 4. Start app

```bash
deno run --watch index.ts
```

:::note Deno will prompt you for various permissions. You can also start Deno
with the appropriate permission flags (`--allow-read --allow-env --allow-net`)
to skip the prompt. :::

Visit [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) in your browser and
refresh a few times to hit the rate limit. You may see 2 requests - one for the
page and one for a favicon.

Wait 10 seconds, then run:

```sh
curl -v http://localhost:3000
```

The wait is necessary because the decision is cached for your IP based on the
`interval` rate limit configuration.

You should see a `403` response because `curl` is considered a bot by default
([customizable](/bot-protection/identifying-bots)).
