Add your key to a `.env` file in your project root.

```ini title=".env"
# NODE_ENV is not set automatically, so tell Arcjet we're in dev
# You can leave this unset in prod
ARCJET_ENV=development
# Get your site key from https://app.arcjet.com
ARCJET_KEY=ajkey_yourkey
```

:::caution[IP Address]
Since Deno doesn't set `NODE_ENV` for you, you also need to set `ARCJET_ENV` in
your environment file. This allows Arcjet to accept a local IP address for
development purposes.
