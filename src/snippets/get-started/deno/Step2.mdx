Add your key to a `.env` file your project root.

```ini title=".env"
# NODE_ENV is not set automatically, so tell Arcjet we're in dev
# You can leave this unset in prod
ARCJET_ENV=development
# Get your site key from https://app.arcjet.com
ARCJET_KEY=ajkey_yourkey
```

:::caution[IP Address]
Arcjet only accepts non-local IP addresses with a fallback to 127.0.0.1 in
development mode. Since Deno doesn't set `NODE_ENV` for you, you also need to
set `ARCJET_ENV` in your environment file.
