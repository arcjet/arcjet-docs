The Arcjet Nuxt integration reads your Arcjet key from the `ARCJET_KEY`
environment variable. During development, add your key to a `.env` file
in your project root. Nuxt will automatically load the environment
variables from this file, learn more in the
[Nuxt docs](https://nuxt.com/docs/4.x/api/composables/use-runtime-config#environment-variables).

```ini title=".env"
# Get your site key from https://app.arcjet.com
