## Vulnerability & patch management policy

External vulnerability reports are logged and assigned to an individual
responsible for that component. They will be assessed and a patch released or
update applied within 10 working days. We do not operate a bug bounty program,
but encourage Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure via security@arcjet.com.

We apply security updates within 10 working days or in the case of our SDKs when
building a new release, whichever is sooner. However, in the case of a critical
vulnerability, such as one that is being actively exploited, we aim to implement
a mitigation or patch as quickly as possible. All other updates are reviewed and
applied within 20 working days.

## Compliance

Arcjet has successfully completed a Type 1 System and Organization Controls 2
(SOC 2) examination for the Arcjet Platform as of August 26, 2025.

The examination conducted by [AssurancePoint, LLC](https://assurancepoint.cpa/i)
found that Arcjet Labs, Inc. achieved its service commitments and system
requirements as measured by the SOC 2 criteria for Security, Availability, and
Confidentiality. The examination concluded in an unqualified (clean) opinion.

We are now in the process of completing our SOC2 Type 2 examination.
