Arcjet has been architected around a few key principles:

- Proper security protections need the full context of the application, which is
  why security rules and protections should be located alongside the code they
  are protecting.
- Security rules should be easy to test. You should be able to run them in
  development as well as production.
- Arcjet should not interfere with the rest of the application. It should be
  easy to install, must not add significant latency to requests, and should not
  require changes to the application's architecture.

## Primitives

Arcjet provides a set of key primitives which can be used to build security
functionality. Each primitive can be used independently or combined as part of a
pre-configured product.

### Core primitives

- **[Shield](/shield/concepts)** - Protect against common attacks.
- **[Rate Limiting](/rate-limiting/concepts)** - Limit the number of requests
  from a client over a period of time.
- **[Bot Protection](/bot-protection/concepts)** - Detect and block automated
  clients.
- **[Email Validation & Verification](/email-validation/concepts)** - Check
  that an email address is valid.
- **[Sensitive Information](/sensitive-info/concepts)** - Protect against
  clients sending you PII that you do not wish to handle.

## Components

Arcjet has two components:

1. **Arcjet SDK** installed into your application.
2. **Arcjet Cloud API** used to make or report decisions.

### Arcjet SDK

The SDK integrates Arcjet into your application. Security rules are configured
in your code using the SDK and they execute either through a middleware layer or
directly from your application code. You can inspect the response in your code
and decide how to handle it. This could be as simple as blocking the request or
more advanced like flagging an account for review.

The SDK includes a WebAssembly module which is used to analyze requests locally
in your own environment. Where possible, a decision is taken locally and then
reported to Arcjet so that you can view the details in the Arcjet dashboard.
Decisions may also be cached in memory.

#### Example: Local analysis

In this example flow:

1. A client makes an HTTP request to your application.
2. Your platform applies standard DDoS protection through their network
   firewall. Most platforms provide DDoS protection transparently and out of the
   box for no extra cost.
3. Your server (container, serverless function, VM, etc) receives the request.
4. The Arcjet SDK is configured as middleware so it intercepts the request
   before it reaches your application code. Arcjet analyzes the request locally
   based on the rules you configured, then decides to allow the request.
5. Arcjet returns the result and your application code continues to execute as
   normally. You can inspect the decision to understand why Arcjet came to that
   conclusion. An asynchronous report is made to the Arcjet API for post-request
   analysis.

#### Contrast with traditional CDN security services

Traditional CDN security services are typically implemented as a reverse proxy
in front of your application. The security service is a separate entity from
your application, rules can't be adjusted dynamically because it does not have
access to the full context of the request, and it can't be tested locally.

This can lead to false positives and false negatives as the service does not
have the full context of the application.

For example:

1. A client makes an HTTP request to your application.
2. The request is intercepted by the CDN security service.
3. The service analyzes the request and decides to block the request.
4. The request is blocked and the client receives an error message, but your
   application code never sees the request. This can lead to false positives
   where legitimate requests are blocked. If your application had seen the
   request, it may have been able to determine that it was legitimate e.g.
   because the client was logged in.
5. Or, the request is allowed and your code runs, but it has no idea that the
   request was analyzed by the CDN security service and why the request was
   allowed.

### Arcjet Cloud API

In many cases, Arcjet can make a decision locally and report that decision
asynchronously to the Arcjet API. However, there are some cases where Arcjet
must make a decision in the cloud.

For example, if you are want to enforce a rate limit, the number of requests for
each client must be tracked. This means you typically need to manage something
like Redis or another database, something that is particularly tricky in
serverless environments. If you are using Arcjet, this is managed for you with
no additional infrastructure. The Arcjet SDK will make a call to the Arcjet API
to get the current rate limit for the client.

The API has been designed for high performance and low latency, and combines all
security functionality in one request. This means it typically outperforms other
similar solutions. Arcjet will also attempt to cache decisions locally using an
in-memory cache. In many cases, the total latency will be less than 1ms.

#### Example: Rate limit rule (allow)

1. A client makes an HTTP request to your application. It passes through the
   network level DDoS protection as described above then reaches your server.
2. The Arcjet SDK is configured with a rate limit rule on an API route. The SDK
   passes the request context through to the Arcjet API which checks the rate
   limit for that client and then returns an allow decision.
3. The SDK returns the details and your application code continues to execute as
   normal.

<img
  class="dark"
  src={ImageExampleRateLimitRuleAllowDark.src}
  alt="Example: Rate limit rule ALLOW"
/>
<img
  class="light"
  src={ImageExampleRateLimitRuleAllowLight.src}
  alt="Example: Rate limit rule ALLOW"
/>

#### Example: Rate limit rule (deny)

This time when the request is received, the rate limit has been exceeded.

1. A client makes another request to your application with a rate limit rule
   configured.
2. As before, the SDK passes the request context through to the Arcjet API which
   determines the limit has been exceeded.
3. The SDK provides the details and your application code returns a 429 response
   to the client.
4. The decision is also cached locally so that subsequent requests which match
   the rate limit rule does not need to rely on a call to the Arcjet API.

<img
  class="dark"
  src={ImageExampleRateLimitRuleDenyCachedDark.src}
  alt="Example: Rate limit rule DENY (CACHED)"
/>
<img
  class="light"
  src={ImageExampleRateLimitRuleDenyCachedLight.src}
  alt="Example: Rate limit rule DENY (CACHED)"
/>

This means that if the same client makes another request, the SDK will read from
the local cache and return the response immediately:

<img
  class="dark"
  src={ImageExampleRateLimitRuleDenyDark.src}
  alt="Example: Rate limit rule DENY"
/>
<img
  class="light"
  src={ImageExampleRateLimitRuleDenyLight.src}
  alt="Example: Rate limit rule DENY"
/>

#### When the API is required

A call to the Arcjet API is required when:

- A [shield](/shield/concepts) rule is configured. Behavior must be compared
  across multiple requests to protect against common attacks.
- A [rate limit](/rate-limiting/concepts) rule is configured. Client state must
  be tracked across requests to enforce the rate limit. Arcjet manages tracking
  this state for you so you do not need deal with other infrastructure or
  services.
- A [bot protection](/bot-protection/concepts) rule is configured and local
  analysis of the client request does not provide enough information to make a
  decision. Local analysis is limited to the request headers whereas the Arcjet
  API also checks a live database of known bots, IP addresses, VPNs, proxies,
  Tor nodes, and other relays.
- An [email validation](/email-validation/concepts) rule is configured and the
  email address syntax is valid. The Arcjet SDK analyzes the email address
  locally to check the syntax. If it is invalid, the SDK will return a decision
  immediately. If it is valid, the SDK will make a call to the Arcjet API to
  verify the email address e.g. does it have a valid MX record or is it a
  disposable email address.

#### API latency

The Arcjet SDK tries to do as much as possible asynchronously and locally to
minimize latency for each request. This adds less than 1ms of overhead to a
typical request.

When a call to the Arcjet API is required there is some additional latency
before a decision is made. The Arcjet API has been designed for high performance
and low latency, and is deployed to multiple regions around the world. The SDK
will automatically use the closest region which means the total overhead is
typically no more than 20-30ms, often significantly less.

Arcjet only ever makes a single call to the API regardless of the number of
rules configured.

Where a decision has been cached locally e.g. blocking a client, Arcjet will
continue to function even if the service is unavailable. In the event of a
network problem or outage and a call to the API is needed, the Arcjet SDK
defaults to failing open so all requests will be allowed. This is a deliberate
design decision to ensure that your application continues to function even if
there is a problem, but you can configure the SDK to fail closed if you prefer.
See an example of how to handle errors and fail open or closed in the [Node.js
SDK reference](/reference/nodejs#error-handling).

## Fingerprinting

Arcjet tracks clients across multiple requests so that suspicious activity can
be detected. This is done by fingerprinting each request within your environment
through a component within the Arcjet SDK.

The fingerprint is a SHA-256 string generated based on request characteristics.
The goal is that a single client will always generate the same fingerprint so we
can detect suspicious requests and block the client. Behind the scenes, Arcjet
uses this to cache decisions locally in your environment and in the Arcjet
decision API.

The fingerprint is configured based on the characteristics configured on the
root of the SDK instance. If unspecified, the IP address is used by default. You
can override this with any of the built-in or custom characteristics. The
fingerprint can also be [configured on each rate limit
rule](/rate-limiting/configuration) to apply a different rule to different
clients based on their characteristics. If not specified, the root fingerprint
is used.

### Built-in characteristics

Built-in options are managed by the SDK and are always available. If multiple
options are provided, they will be combined.

:::caution
If you specify different characteristics and do not include `ip.src`, you may
inadvertently generate the same fingerprint for multiple users.
Be sure to include a characteristic which can narrowly identify each client.
For example, use a header value to limit based on a session token or authentication header.
:::

| Option                                        |     Description      |
| :-------------------------------------------- | :------------------: |
| `ip.src`                                      |  Client IP address   |
| `http.host`                                   |     Request host     |
| `http.request.headers["<header_name>"]`       | Request header value |
| `http.request.cookie["<cookie_name>"]`        | Request cookie value |
| `http.request.uri.args["<query_param_name>"]` | Request query value  |
| `http.request.uri.path`                       |     Request path     |

### Custom characteristics

You can use custom characteristics to track rate limits. For example, you can
set up a limit for a logged in user by setting their user ID as the identifier.
This will apply the limit to all requests made by that user regardless of their
device and IP address.

Custom characteristics are defined with a string key when configuring the sdk.
The value is then passed as a `string`, `number` or `boolean` when
calling the `protect` method. You can use any string value for the key.

:::caution
Avoid passing personal information such as an email address as a custom
characteristic. The value is hashed on Arcjet's servers, but it's still a best
practice to avoid sending us sensitive information.
:::

### IP address detection

The client IP address is a key part of the fingerprint. The IP should not be
trusted as it can be spoofed in most cases, especially when loaded via the
`Headers` object. Each Arcjet SDK uses a native method to detect the IP address
generally following the guidance provided by the [MDN X-Forwarded-For
documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-For).

When choosing the IP address to use, Arcjet uses the first non-private IP that
is a valid address. However, in non-production environments, we allow
private/internal addresses so the SDKs work correctly. See the individual SDK
references for more details.

## Request analysis

Arcjet analyzes every request to your application in real-time. This is based on
the rules you configure and the SDK provides the result so you can decide
whether to deny or allow requests, or to take other actions.

Post-request analysis is also performed by the Arcjet platform. This allows
Arcjet to detect other types of attacks, such as SQL injection or other
suspicious activity. This is threshold-based to avoid false positives. Once a
client reaches a threshold of suspicious activity, Arcjet will issue a deny
decision for that client for a period of time.

This threshold is dynamic and regularly updated based on the latest attack
patterns. This protection is automatic and does not require any configuration.
You can see the details of all requests, including those that are denied, in
the [Arcjet dashboard](https://app.arcjet.com).

The results of this analysis are used regardless of the rules configured. This
means Arcjet is continuously analyzing requests to your application and
protecting it from attacks.

In the example below, the results of the post-request analysis from previous
requests are used to inform the decision for the current request.

1. A client makes an HTTP request to your application.
2. The request is analyzed by the Arcjet SDK based on the rules you configured.
3. The SDK returns the result and your application code continues to execute as
   normal.
4. The result is also reported to the Arcjet API for post-request analysis. This
   is used to inform future decisions for that client.
5. The client makes another request and the result of the post-request analysis
   is used to inform the decision. This will be applied if you have configured a
   [Shield](/shield/quick-start) rule.
