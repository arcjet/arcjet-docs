Arcjet signup form protection combines rate limiting, bot protection, and email
validation to protect your signup forms from abuse.

## Configuration

Signup form protection is a combination of the [rate
limiting](/rate-limiting/quick-start/nextjs), [bot
protection](/bot-protection/quick-start/nextjs), and [email
validation](/email-validation/quick-start/nextjs) primitives. The configuration
options are the same, but specified in a single rule.

The configuration definition is:

```ts
type ProtectSignupOptions = {
  rateLimit?: SlidingWindowRateLimitOptions | SlidingWindowRateLimitOptions[];
  bots?: BotOptions | BotOptions[];
  email?: EmailOptions | EmailOptions[];
};
```

The `arcjet` client is configured with one `protectSignup` rule which take
`ProtectSignupOptions`.

### Server Actions

See our [example in the SDK reference](/reference/nextjs#server-actions).

### Recommended configuration

Our recommended configuration for most signup forms is:

- Block emails with invalid syntax, that are from disposable email providers, or
  do not have valid MX records configured.
- Block clients that we are sure are automated.
- Apply a rate limit of 5 submissions per 10 minutes from a single IP address.

This can be configured as follows:

<Code code={RecommendedTS} lang="ts" />

### Testing with dry run mode

When you are testing your signup form protection configuration, you can run the
rules in dry run mode first by setting `mode` to `DRY_RUN`. This will return an
allow decision for every request, but log what the results would have been if
they were in live mode. You can view the results in the [Arcjet
dashboard](https://app.arcjet.com).

Even in dry run mode each rule will still be evaluated, so you can still [check
the rule results](#checking-rule-results) to see if the email address is valid
or not, or log them to your database.

## Decision

Arcjet provides a single `protect` function that is used to execute your
protection rules. This requires a `request` argument which is the request
context as passed to the request handler. When configured with a `protectSignup`
rule it also requires an additional `email` prop.

This function returns a `Promise` that resolves to an
`ArcjetDecision` object. This contains the following properties:

- `id` (`string`) - The unique ID for the request. This can be used to look up
  the request in the Arcjet dashboard. It is prefixed with `req_` for decisions
  involving the Arcjet cloud API. For decisions taken locally, the prefix is
  `lreq_`.
- `conclusion` (`ArcjetConclusion`) - The final conclusion based on evaluating
  each of the configured rules. If you wish to accept Arcjet's recommended
  action based on the configured rules then you can use this property.
- `reason` (`ArcjetReason`) - An object containing more detailed
  information about the conclusion.
- `results` (`ArcjetRuleResult[]`) - An array of `ArcjetRuleResult` objects
  containing the results of each rule that was executed.
- `ip` (`ArcjetIpDetails`) - An object containing Arcjet's analysis of the
  client IP address. See [IP analysis](/reference/nextjs/#ip-analysis) in the
  SDK reference for more information.

See [the SDK reference](/reference/nextjs#results) for more details about the
response.

### Accepting our recommended action

The `conclusion` property contains the final conclusion based on evaluating each
of the configured rules. The quick start example code above uses this property
to accept Arcjet's recommended action - display an error to the user if their
email is rejected, otherwise return a `403` error.

You can check if a deny decision was returned by using `decision.isDenied()`. To
narrow down the reason to an email validation rule, you can use
`decision.reason.isEmail()`.

### Checking rule results

You can iterate through the results of each rule:

```ts
for (const result of decision.results) {
  console.log("Rule Result", result);
}
```

This could be useful metadata to add to a new user's record in your database
before you redirect them to the next step in your signup flow.

See [the SDK reference](/reference/nextjs#results) for more details about the
rule results.

### Custom verification logic

Checking the rule results allows you to use the Arcjet decision as part of your
own verification logic. For example, you could decide to manually verify user
signups that come from IP addresses associated with proxies or Tor, and any
users who sign up with a free email address.

## Error handling

Arcjet is designed to fail open so that a service issue or misconfiguration does
not block all requests. The SDK will also time out and fail open after 500ms
when `NODE_ENV` is `production` and 1000ms otherwise. However, in most cases,
the response time will be less than 20-30ms.

If there is an error condition, Arcjet will return an `ERROR` `conclusion`.
