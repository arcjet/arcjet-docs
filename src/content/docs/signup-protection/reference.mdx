Arcjet signup form protection combines rate limiting, bot protection, and email
validation to protect your signup forms from abuse.

## Plan availability

Arcjet signup form protection availability depends depends on your
[pricing plan](https://arcjet.com/pricing).

| Plan                                                                             | Signup form protection                                 |

## Configuration

Signup form protection is a combination of the
[rate limiting](/rate-limiting/quick-start?f=next-js),
[bot protection](/bot-protection/quick-start?f=next-js), and
[email validation](/email-validation/quick-start?f=next-js) primitives. The
configuration options are the same, but specified in a single rule.

The configuration definition is:

```ts
type ProtectSignupOptions = {
  rateLimit?: SlidingWindowRateLimitOptions | SlidingWindowRateLimitOptions[];
  bots?:
    | BotOptionsAllow
    | BotOptionsDeny
    | BotOptionsAllow[]
    | BotOptionsDeny[];
  email?: EmailOptions | EmailOptions[];
};
```

The `arcjet` client is configured with one `protectSignup` rule which take
`ProtectSignupOptions`.

### Recommended configuration

Our recommended configuration for most signup forms is:

- Block emails with invalid syntax, that are from disposable email providers, or
  do not have valid MX records configured.
- Block clients that we are sure are automated.
- Apply a rate limit of 5 submissions per 10 minutes from a single IP address.

This can be configured as follows:

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <RecommendedBun slot="bun" />
  <RecommendedNestJs slot="nest-js" />
  <RecommendedNextJs slot="next-js" />
  <RecommendedNodeJs slot="node-js" />
  <RecommendedRemix slot="remix" />
  <RecommendedSvelteKit slot="sveltekit" />
</SlotByFramework>

### Testing with dry run mode

When you are testing your signup form protection configuration, you can run the
rules in dry run mode first by setting `mode` to `DRY_RUN`. This will return an
allow decision for every request, but log what the results would have been if
they were in live mode. You can view the results in the
[Arcjet dashboard](https://app.arcjet.com).

Even in dry run mode each rule will still be evaluated, so you can still
[check the rule results](#checking-rule-results) to see if the email address is
valid or not, or log them to your database.

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <NextJsPagesServerActions slot="next-js" />
</SlotByFramework>

## Decision

Arcjet provides a single `protect` function that is used to execute your
protection rules. This requires a `request` argument which is the request
context as passed to the request handler. When configured with a `protectSignup`
rule it also requires an additional `email` prop.

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <NestJsGuardDecision slot="nest-js" />
</SlotByFramework>

This function returns a `Promise` that resolves to an `ArcjetDecision` object.
This contains the following properties:

- `id` (`string`) - The unique ID for the request. This can be used to look up
  the request in the Arcjet dashboard. It is prefixed with `req_` for decisions
  involving the Arcjet cloud API. For decisions taken locally, the prefix is
  `lreq_`.
- `conclusion` (`ArcjetConclusion`) - The final conclusion based on evaluating
  each of the configured rules. If you wish to accept Arcjet's recommended
  action based on the configured rules then you can use this property.
- `reason` (`ArcjetReason`) - An object containing more detailed information
  about the conclusion.
- `results` (`ArcjetRuleResult[]`) - An array of `ArcjetRuleResult` objects
  containing the results of each rule that was executed.
- `ip` (`ArcjetIpDetails`) - An object containing Arcjet's analysis of the
  client IP address. See the SDK reference for more information.

### Accepting our recommended action

The `conclusion` property contains the final conclusion based on evaluating each
of the configured rules. The quick start example code above uses this property
to accept Arcjet's recommended action - display an error to the user if their
email is rejected, otherwise return a `403` error.

You can check if a deny decision was returned by using `decision.isDenied()`. To
narrow down the reason to an email validation rule, you can use
`decision.reason.isEmail()`.

### Checking rule results

You can iterate through the results of each rule:

```ts
for (const result of decision.results) {
  console.log("Rule Result", result);
}
```

This could be useful metadata to add to a new user's record in your database
before you redirect them to the next step in your signup flow.

### Custom verification logic

Checking the rule results allows you to use the Arcjet decision as part of your
own verification logic. For example, you could decide to manually verify user
signups that come from IP addresses associated with proxies or Tor, and any
users who sign up with a free email address.

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <CustomVerificationBun slot="bun" />
  <CustomVerificationNestJs slot="nest-js" />
  <CustomVerificationNextJs slot="next-js" />
  <CustomVerificationNodeJs slot="node-js" />
  <CustomVerificationRemix slot="remix" />
  <CustomVerificationSvelteKit slot="sveltekit" />
</SlotByFramework>

## Error handling

Arcjet is designed to fail open so that a service issue or misconfiguration does
not block all requests. The SDK will also time out and fail open after 1000ms
when `NODE_ENV` or `ARCJET_ENV` is `development` and 500ms otherwise. However,
in most cases, the response time will be less than 20-30ms.

If there is an error condition when processing the rule, Arcjet will return an
`ERROR` result for that rule and you can check the `message` property on the
rule's error result for more information.

If all other rules that were run returned an `ALLOW` result, then the final
Arcjet conclusion will be `ERROR`.

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <ErrorsBun slot="bun" />
  <ErrorsNestJs slot="nest-js" />
  <ErrorsNextJs slot="next-js" />
  <ErrorsNodeJs slot="node-js" />
  <ErrorsRemix slot="remix" />
  <ErrorsSvelteKit slot="sveltekit" />
</SlotByFramework>

## Testing

Arcjet runs the same in any environment, including locally and in CI. You can
use the `mode` set to `DRY_RUN` to log the results of rule execution without
blocking any requests.

We have an example test framework you can use to automatically test your rules.
Arcjet can also be triggered based using a sample of your traffic.

See the [Testing](/testing) section of the docs for details.
