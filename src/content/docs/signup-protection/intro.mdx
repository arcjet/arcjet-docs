With Arcjet Signup form protection you can combines bot protection,
email validation, and
rate limiting,
to protect your signup forms from abuse.

## When to use

You can use Signup form protection to help protect signup forms
from abuse by malicious actors.

You can also mix and match the individual protections
[Arcjet Bot protection][arcjet-bot-protection],
[Arcjet Email validation][arcjet-email-validation], and
[Arcjet Rate limiting][arcjet-rate-limiting].

## How it works

This is a pre-built product that combines primitives which can also be used
individually.
It comes with our recommended configuration.
This saves you time and means you can get value from Arcjet with a few lines of
code in just a few minutes.

This product combines primitives to minimize the number of fake and fraudulent
accounts that sign up:

- **[Rate limiting][arcjet-rate-limiting]**
  — signup forms are a common target for bots. Arcjet's rate
  limiting helps to prevent bots and other automated or malicious clients from
  submitting your signup form too many times in a short period of time. Even
  allowing for errors, legitimate users do not usually submit forms more than a
  few times in a short time window.
- **[Bot protection][arcjet-bot-protection]**
  — signup forms are usually exclusively used by humans,
  which means that any automated submissions to the form are likely to be
  fraudulent. However, critical transaction forms are often tested by legitimate
  automated clients, such as monitoring services. These can be specifically
  allowed.
- **[Email validation][arcjet-email-validation]**
  — email addresses should be validated to ensure the
  signup is coming from a legitimate user with a real email address that can
  actually receive messages. Some services may also want to restrict signups to
  avoid disposable or free email addresses.
