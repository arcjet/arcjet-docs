Arcjet signup form protection combines rate limiting, bot protection, and email
validation to protect your signup forms from abuse.

<WhatIsArcjet />

## How does it work?

Arcjet's SDK provides a set of core primitives which can be used independently.
The SDK also provide a set of pre-built products which combine these primitives
with our recommended configuration. This saves you time and means you can get
value from Arcjet with a single rule in just a few minutes.

The Arcjet signup form protection product combines [rate
limiting](/rate-limiting/concepts), [bot protection](/bot-protection/concepts),
and [email validation](/email-validation/concepts) to help minimize the number
of fake or fraudulent accounts that sign up to your service.

- **Rate limiting** - signup forms are a common target for bots. Arcjet's rate
  limiting helps to prevent bots and other automated or malicious clients from
  submitting your signup form too many times in a short period of time. Even
  allowing for errors, legitimate users do not usually submit forms more than a
  few times in a short time window.
- **Bot protection** - signup forms are usually exclusively used by humans,
  which means that any automated submissions to the form are likely to be
  fraudulent. However, critical transaction forms are often tested by legitimate
  automated clients, such as monitoring services. These can be specifically
  allowed.
- **Email validation** - email addresses should be validated to ensure the
  signup is coming from a legitimate user with a real email address that can
  actually receive messages. Some services may also want to restrict signups to
  avoid disposable or free email addresses.

You can accept the default configuration and block suspicious submissions with
just a few lines of code. Or you can customize the configuration and integrate
the results into custom workflows, such as manually approving suspicious
submissions.
