The Arcjet Nosecone library provides a streamlined way to apply secure headers
to your application.

## API

### `nosecone(options?: NoseconeOptions): Headers`

The default export is a function that returns a set of `Headers` to apply to a
request that help you secure your application. The defaults should work for many
applications, but all can be configured or disabled for specific requirements.

### `NoseconeOptions`

All entries in `NoseconeOptions` can be enabled with defaults by specifying
`true` or disabled by specifying `false`. Additionally, many allow individual
configuration via their own configuration objects, which override any defaults.

You can use object spread, e.g. `...defaults`, to combine the default values
with your overrides.

```ts
interface NoseconeOptions {
  /**
   * Configure the `Content-Security-Policy` header, which helps mitigate a
   * large number of * attacks, such as cross-site scripting.
   */
  contentSecurityPolicy?: ContentSecurityPolicyConfig | boolean;
  /**
   * Configure the `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy` header, which helps control
   * what resources can be loaded cross-origin.
   */
  crossOriginEmbedderPolicy?: CrossOriginEmbedderPolicyConfig | boolean;
  /**
   * Configure the `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` header, which helps
   * process-isolate your page.
   */
  crossOriginOpenerPolicy?: CrossOriginOpenerPolicyConfig | boolean;
  /**
   * Configure the `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy` header, which blocks others
   * from loading your resources cross-origin in some cases.
   */
  crossOriginResourcePolicy?: CrossOriginResourcePolicyConfig | boolean;
  /**
   * Configure the `Origin-Agent-Cluster` header, which provides a mechanism to
   * allow web applications to isolate their origins from other processes.
   */
  originAgentCluster?: boolean;
  /**
   * Configure the `Referrer-Policy` header, which controls what information is
   * set in the `Referer` request header.
   */
  referrerPolicy?: ReferrerPolicyConfig | boolean;
  /**
   * Configure the `Strict-Transport-Security` header, which tells browsers to
   * prefer HTTPS instead of insecure HTTP.
   */
  strictTransportSecurity?: StrictTransportSecurityConfig | boolean;
  /**
   * Configure the `X-Content-Type-Options` header, which helps mitigate MIME
   * type sniffing that can cause security issues.
   */
  xContentTypeOptions?: boolean;
  /**
   * Configure the `X-DNS-Prefetch-Control` header, which helps control DNS
   * prefetching to improve user privacy at the expense of performance.
   */
  xDnsPrefetchControl?: DnsPrefetchControlConfig | boolean;
  /**
   * Configure the `X-Download-Options` header, which prevents a user from
   * opening a file directly in Internet Explorer 8 to avoid prevent script
   * injection.
   */
  xDownloadOptions?: boolean;
  /**
   * Configure the `X-Frame-Options` header, which help mitigate clickjacking
   * attacks in legacy browsers. This header is superceded by a directive in the
   * `Content-Security-Policy` header.
   */
  xFrameOptions?: FrameOptionsConfig | boolean;
  /**
   * Configure the `X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies` header, which tells some
   * clients, like Adobe products, your domain's policy for loading cross-domain
   * content.
   */
  xPermittedCrossDomainPolicies?: PermittedCrossDomainPoliciesConfig | boolean;
  /**
   * Disable the `X-XSS-Protection` header, which could introduce a browser
   * side-channel if enabled.
   */
  xXssProtection?: boolean;
}
```

## Headers

### `Content-Security-Policy`

The `Content-Security-Policy` header helps mitigate a large number of attacks,
such as cross-site scripting.
