[<SDKVersionSvelteKit/>](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arcjet/sveltekit)

This is the reference guide for the Arcjet SvelteKit SDK, [available on
GitHub](https://github.com/arcjet/arcjet-js) and licensed under the Apache 2.0
license.

<WhatIsArcjet />

## Installation

In your project root, run the following command to install the SDK:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Tabs>
<TabItem label="npm">
```sh
npm i @arcjet/sveltekit
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">
```sh
pnpm add @arcjet/sveltekit
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="yarn">
```sh
yarn add @arcjet/sveltekit
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Quick start

Check out the [quick start guide](/get-started/sveltekit).

## Configuration

Create a new `Arcjet` object with your API key and rules. This should be in a
server-only module in `/src/lib/server/`.

The required fields are:

- `key` (`string`) - Your Arcjet site key. This can be found in the SDK
  Installation section for the site in the [Arcjet
  Dashboard](https://app.arcjet.com).
- `rules` - The rules to apply to the request. See the various sections of the
  docs for how to configure these e.g. [shield](/shield/reference/sveltekit), [rate
  limiting](/rate-limiting/reference/sveltekit), [bot
  protection](/bot-protection/reference/sveltekit), [email
  validation](/email-validation/reference/sveltekit).

The optional fields are:

- `characteristics` (`string[]`) - A list of
  [characteristics](/architecture#built-in-characteristics) to be used to
  uniquely identify clients.

    <Code code={ConfigurationTS} lang="ts" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="JS">
    <Code code={ConfigurationJS} lang="js" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Rule modes

Each rule can be configured in either `LIVE` or `DRY_RUN` mode. When in
`DRY_RUN` mode, each rule will return its decision, but the end conclusion will
always be `ALLOW`.

This allows you to run Arcjet in passive / demo mode to test rules before
enabling them. Arcjet will log what it would have done.

```ts
import arcjet, { fixedWindow } from "@arcjet/sveltekit";

const aj = arcjet({
  key: process.env.ARCJET_KEY!,
  characteristics: ["ip.src"],
  rules: [
    fixedWindow(
      // This rule is live
      {
        mode: "LIVE",
        match: "/api/arcjet",
        window: "1h",
        max: 60,
      },
      // This rule is in dry run mode, so will log but not block
      {
        mode: "DRY_RUN",
        match: "/api/arcjet",
        characteristics: ['http.request.headers["x-api-key"]'],
        window: "1h",
        // max could also be a dynamic value applied after looking up a limit
        // elsewhere e.g. in a database for the authenticated user
        max: 600,
      },
    ),
  ],
});
```

### Multiple rules

You can combine rules to create a more complex protection strategy. For example,
you can combine rate limiting and bot protection rules to protect your API from
automated clients.

:::note
When specifying multiple rules, the order of the rules is ignored. Rule
execution ordering is automatically optimized for performance.

### Environment variables

The following environment variables can be used to configure the SDK at runtime:

- `ARCJET_BASE_URL` - Will override the decision API which the SDK communicates
  with. This defaults to `https://decide.arcjet.com` and should only be changed
  if directed by Arcjet support.
- `ARCJET_LOG_LEVEL` - The log level to use, either `debug`, `info`, `warn`, or
  `error`. Defaults to `warn`. If a rule is in dry run mode, a warning will be
  output with the decision that would have been applied.
- `ARCJET_ENV` - Set to `development` to force Arcjet into development mode.
  This will allow private/internal addresses so that the SDKs work correctly
  locally. You usually do not need to set this because it uses `NODE_ENV` when
  set. See
  [Troubleshooting](/troubleshooting#generatefingerprint-ip-is-empty--failed_precondition-client-ip-not-provided)
  for when this may be needed.

### Custom logging

The SDK uses a lightweight logger which mirrors the
[Pino](https://github.com/pinojs/pino) [structured
logger](https://github.com/pinojs/pino/blob/8db130eba0439e61c802448d31eb1998cebfbc98/docs/api.md#logger)
interface. You can use this to customize the logging output.

First, install the required packages:

```shell
npm install pino pino-pretty
```

Then, create a custom logger that will log to JSON in production and pretty
print in development:

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Protect

Arcjet provides a single `protect` function that is used to execute your
protection rules. This requires a `RequestEvent` object which is the event
argument as passed to the SvelteKit request handler. Rules you add to the SDK may
require additional details, such as the `validateEmail` rule requiring an
additional `email` prop.

This function returns a `Promise` that resolves to an `ArcjetDecision` object,
which provides a high-level conclusion and detailed explanations of the decision
made by Arcjet.

A good place to put this is in your app's server hooks file:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="TS">
    <Code code={ProtectTS} title="/src/hooks.server.ts" lang="ts" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="JS">
    <Code code={ProtectJS} title="/src/hooks.server.js" lang="js" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Decision

The `protect` function function returns a `Promise` that resolves to an
`ArcjetDecision` object. This contains the following properties:

- `id` (`string`) - The unique ID for the request. This can be used to look up
  the request in the Arcjet dashboard. It is prefixed with `req_` for decisions
  involving the Arcjet cloud API. For decisions taken locally, the prefix is
  `lreq_`.
- `conclusion` (`"ALLOW" | "DENY" | "CHALLENGE" | "ERROR"`) - The final
  conclusion based on evaluating each of the configured rules. If you wish to
  accept Arcjet's recommended action based on the configured rules then you can
  use this property.
- `reason` (`ArcjetReason`) - An object containing more detailed
  information about the conclusion.
- `results` (`ArcjetRuleResult[]`) - An array of `ArcjetRuleResult` objects
  containing the results of each rule that was executed.
- `ttl` (`uint32`) - The time-to-live for the decision in seconds. This is the
  time that the decision is valid for. After this time, the decision will be
  re-evaluated. The SDK automatically caches `DENY` decisions for the length of
  the TTL.
- `ip` (`ArcjetIpDetails`) - An object containing Arcjet's analysis of the
  client IP address. See [IP analysis](#ip-analysis) below for more information.

### Conclusion

The `ArcjetDecision` object has the following methods that should be used to
check the conclusion:

- `isAllowed()` (`bool`) - The request should be allowed.
- `isDenied()` (`bool`) - The request should be denied.
- `isErrored()` (`bool`) - There was an unrecoverable error.

### Reason

The `reason` property of the `ArcjetDecision` object contains an `ArcjetReason`
object which provides more detailed information about the conclusion. This is
the final decision reason and is based on the configured rules.

The `ArcjetReason` object has the following methods that can be used to check
which rule caused the conclusion:

- `isBot()` (`bool`) - Returns `true` if the bot protection rules have been
  applied and the request was considered to have been made by a bot.
- `isRateLimit()` (`bool`) - Returns `true` if the rate limit rules have been
  applied and the request has exceeded the rate limit.
- `isShield()` (`bool`) - Returns `true` if the shield rules have been applied
  and the request is suspicious based on analysis by Arcjet Shield.
- `isEmail()` (`bool`) - Returns `true` if the email validation rules have been
  applied and the email address has a problem.
- `isErrored()` (`bool`) - Returns `true` if there was an error processing the
  request.

### Results

The `results` property of the `ArcjetDecision` object contains an array of
`ArcjetRuleResult` objects. There will be one for each configured rule so you
can inspect the individual results:

- `id` (`string`) - The ID of the rule result. Not yet implemented.
- `state` (`ArcjetRuleState`) - Whether the rule was executed or not.
- `conclusion` (`ArcjetConclusion`) - The conclusion of the rule. This will be
  one of the above conclusions: `ALLOW`, `DENY`, `CHALLENGE`, or `ERROR`.
- `reason` (`ArcjetReason`) - An object containing more detailed information
  about the conclusion for this rule. Each rule type has its own reason object
  with different properties.

You can iterate through the results and check the conclusion for each rule.

```ts
for (const result of decision.results) {
  console.log("Rule Result", result);
}
```

This example will log the full result as well as each rate limit rule:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="TS">
    <Code
      code={DecisionLogTS}
      title="/src/hooks.server.ts"
      lang="ts"
      mark={[{ range: "31-41" }]}
    />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="JS">
    <Code
      code={DecisionLogJS}
      title="/src/hooks.server.js"
      lang="js"
      mark={[{ range: "25-35" }]}
    />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Rule state

The `state` property of the `ArcjetRuleResult` object is an `ArcjetRuleState`.
Each rule is evaluated individually and can be in one of the following states:

- `DRY_RUN` - The rule was executed in dry run mode. This means that the rule
  was executed but the conclusion was not applied to the request. This is useful
  for testing rules before enabling them.
- `RUN` - The rule was executed and the conclusion was applied to the request.
- `NOT_RUN` - The rule was not executed. This can happen if another rule has
  already reached a conclusion that applies to the request. For example, if a
  rate limit rule is configured then these are evaluated before all other rules.
  If the client has reached the maximum number of requests then other rules will
  not be evaluated.
- `CACHED` - The rule was not executed because the previous result was cached.
  Results are cached when the decision conclusion is `DENY`. Subsequent requests
  from the same client will not be evaluated against the rule until the cache
  expires.

#### Rule reason

The `reason` property of the `ArcjetRuleResult` object contains an
`ArcjetReason` object which provides more detailed information about the
conclusion for that configured rule.

##### Shield

The `ArcjetReason` object for shield rules has the following properties:

```ts
shieldTriggered: boolean;
```

See the [shield documentation](/shield/reference/sveltekit) for more information
about these properties.

##### Bot protection

The `ArcjetReason` object for bot protection rules has the following properties:

```ts
allowed: string[];
denied: string[];
```

Each of the `allowed` and `denied` arrays contains the identifiers of the bots
allowed or denied from the [list of bots in our SDK
repository](https://github.com/arcjet/arcjet-js/blob/main/protocol/well-known-bots.ts).

##### Rate limiting

The `ArcjetReason` object for rate limiting rules has the following properties:

```ts
max: number;
remaining: number;
window: number;
reset: number;
```

See the [rate limiting documentation](/rate-limiting/reference/sveltekit) for more
information about these properties.

##### Email validation & verification

The `ArcjetReason` object for email rules has the following properties:

```ts
emailTypes: ArcjetEmailType[];
```

An `ArcjetEmailType` is one of the following strings:

```ts
"DISPOSABLE" | "FREE" | "NO_MX_RECORDS" | "NO_GRAVATAR" | "INVALID";
```

See the [email validation documentation](/email-validation/reference/sveltekit) for
more information about these properties.

### IP analysis

As of SDK version `1.0.0-alpha.11`, the `ArcjetDecision` object contains an `ip`
property. This includes additional data about the client IP address:

#### IP location

The IP location fields may be `undefined`, but you can use various methods to
check their availability. Using the methods will also refine the type to remove
the need for null or undefined checks.

- `hasLatitude()` (`bool`): returns whether the `latitude` and `accuracyRadius`
  fields are available.
- `hasLongitude()` (`bool`): returns whether the `longitude` and
  `accuracyRadius` fields are available.
- `hasAccuracyRadius()` (`bool`): returns whether the `longitude`, `latitude`,
  and `accuracyRadius` fields are available.
- `hasTimezone()` (`bool`): returns whether the `timezone` field is available.
- `hasPostalCode()` (`bool`): returns whether the `postalCode` field is
  available.
- `hasCity()` (`bool`): returns whether the `city` field is available.
- `hasRegion()` (`bool`): returns whether the `region` field is available.
- `hasCountry()` (`bool`): returns whether the `country` and `countryName`
  fields are available.
- `hasContinent()` (`bool`): returns whether the `continent` and `continentName`
  fields are available.
- `latitude` (`number | undefined`): the latitude of the client IP address.
- `longitude` (`number | undefined`): the longitude of the client IP address.
- `accuracyRadius` (`number | undefined`): how accurate the location is in
  kilometers.
- `timezone` (`string | undefined`): the timezone of the client IP address.
- `postalCode` (`string | undefined`): the postal or zip code of the client IP
  address.
- `city` (`string | undefined`): the city of the client IP address.
- `region` (`string | undefined`): the region of the client IP address.
- `country` (`string | undefined`): the country code the client IP address.
- `countryName` (`string | undefined`): the country name of the client IP
  address.
- `continent` (`string | undefined`): the continent code of the client IP
  address.
- `continentName` (`string | undefined`): the continent name of the client IP
  address.

##### Location accuracy

IP geolocation can be notoriously inaccurate, especially for mobile devices,
satellite internet providers, and even just normal users. Likewise with the
specific fields like `city` and `region`, which can be very inaccurate. Country
is usually accurate, but there are often cases where IP addresses are
mis-located. These fields are provided for convenience e.g. suggesting a user
location, but should not be relied upon by themselves.

#### IP AS

This is useful for identifying the network operator of the client IP address.
This is useful for understanding whether the client is likely to be automated or
not, or being stricter with requests from certain networks.

The IP AS fields may be `undefined`, but you can use the `hasAsn()` method to
check their availability. Using this method will also refine the type to remove
the need for null-ish checks.

- `hasAsn()` (`bool`): returns whether all of the ASN fields are available.
- `asn` (`string | undefined`): the autonomous system (AS) number of the client
  IP address.
- `asnName` (`string | undefined`): the name of the AS of the client IP address.
- `asnDomain` (`string | undefined`): the domain of the AS of the client IP
  address.
- `asnType` (`'isp' | 'hosting' | 'business' | 'education'`): the type of the AS
  of the client IP address. Real users are more likely to be on an ISP or
  business network rather than a hosting provider. Education networks often have
  a single or small number of IP addresses even though there are many users. A
  common mistake is to block a single IP because of too many requests when it is
  a university or company network using
  [NAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-grade_NAT) (Network Address
  Translation) to give many users the same IP.
- `asnCountry` (`string | undefined`): the country code of the AS of the client
  IP address. This is the administrative country of the AS, not necessarily the
  country of the client IP address.

#### IP type

The `service` field may be `undefined`, but you can use the `hasService()`
method to check the availability. Using this method will also refine the type to
remove the need for null-ish checks.

- `hasService()` (`bool`): whether the `service` field is available.
- `service` (`string | undefined`): the name of the service associated with the
  IP address—e.g. `Apple Private Relay`.
- `isHosting()` (`bool`): returns whether the IP address of the client is owned
  by a hosting provider. Requests originating from a hosting provider IP
  significantly increase the likelihood that this is an automated client.
- `isVpn()` (`bool`): returns whether the IP address of the client is owned by a
  VPN provider. Many people use VPNs for privacy or work purposes, so by itself
  this is not an indicator of the client being automated. However, it does
  increase the risk score of the client and depending on your use case it may be
  a characteristic you wish to restrict.
- `isProxy()` (`bool`): returns whether the IP address of the client is owned by
  a proxy provider. Similar to `isVpn()`, but proxies are more likely to involve
  automated traffic.
- `isTor()` (`bool`): returns whether the IP address of the client is known to
  be part of the Tor network. As with `isVpn()`, there are legitimate uses for
  hiding your identity through Tor, however it is also often a way to hide the
  origin of malicious traffic.
- `isRelay()` (`bool`): returns whether the IP address of the client is owned by
  a relay service. The most common example is Apple iCloud Relay, which
  indicates the client is less likely to be automated because Apple requires a
  paid subscription linked to an Apple account in good standing.

## Error handling

Arcjet is designed to fail open so that a service issue or misconfiguration does
not block all requests. The SDK will also time out and fail open after 500ms
when `NODE_ENV` is `production` and 1000ms otherwise. However, in most cases,
the response time will be less than 20-30ms.

If there is an error condition, Arcjet will return an `ERROR` `conclusion`.

  <TabItem label="TS">
    <Code
      code={ErrorHandlingTS}
      title="/src/hooks.server.ts"
      lang="ts"

      lang="js"
      mark={[{ range: "21-26" }]}
    />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Ad hoc rules

Sometimes it is useful to add additional protection via a rule based on the
logic in your handler; however, you usually want to inherit the rules, cache,
and other configuration from our primary SDK. This can be achieved using the
`withRule` function which accepts an ad-hoc rule and can be chained to add
multiple rules. It returns an augmented client with the specialized `protect`
function.

  <TabItem label="TS">
    <Code
      code={WithRuleTS}
      title="/src/routes/guests-rate-limited/+page.server.ts"

      lang="js"
      mark={[{ range: "20-27" }]}
    />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## IP address detection

Arcjet will automatically detect the IP address of the client making the request
based on the context provided. The implementation is open source in our
[@arcjet/ip package](https://github.com/arcjet/arcjet-js/blob/main/ip).

In non-production environments (`NODE_ENV !== "production"`), we allow
private/internal addresses so that the SDKs work correctly locally.

## Client override

The default client can be overridden. If no client is specified, a default one
will be used. Generally you should not need to provide a client - the Arcjet
SvelteKit SDK will automatically handle this for you.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="TS">
    <Code
      code={ClientOverrideTS}
      lang="ts"
      mark={[{ range: "2,3,6,9-25,38" }]}
    />

      lang="js"
      mark={[{ range: "2,3,6,9-25,38" }]}
    />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
