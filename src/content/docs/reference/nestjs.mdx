[<SDKVersionNestjs />](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arcjet/nest)

This is the reference guide for the Arcjet NestJS SDK, [available on
GitHub](https://github.com/arcjet/arcjet-js) and licensed under the Apache 2.0
license.

<WhatIsArcjet />

## Installation

In your project root, run the following command to install the SDK:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Tabs>
<TabItem label="npm">
```sh
npm i @arcjet/nest
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">
```sh
pnpm add @arcjet/nest
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="yarn">
```sh
yarn add @arcjet/nest
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Requirements

<Requirements />

## Quick start

Check out the [quick start guide](/get-started?f=nest-js).

## Configuration

Create a new root `ArcjetModule.forRoot` object with your API key and any
default rules you want to apply to every route. This is usually in the `app.module.ts` file.

The required fields are:

- `key` (`string`) - Your Arcjet site key. This can be found in the SDK
  Installation section for the site in the [Arcjet
  Dashboard](https://app.arcjet.com).
- `rules` - The rules to apply to the request. This can be empty in the root
  object so you can set rules within each controller. See the various sections
  of the docs for how to configure these e.g.
  [shield](/shield/reference?f=nest-js), [rate
  limiting](/rate-limiting/reference?f=nest-js), [bot
  protection](/bot-protection/reference?f=nest-js), [email
  validation](/email-validation/reference?f=nest-js).

The optional fields are:

- `characteristics` (`string[]`) - A list of
  [characteristics](/architecture#built-in-characteristics) to be used to
  uniquely identify clients.

<Code code={ConfigurationTS} lang="ts" title="src/app.module.ts" />

### Root instance

The `ArcjetModule.forRoot` method creates a root instance of the `Arcjet`
object. This can be called through a global guard, per route guards for each
controller, or directly in the controller.

Having a single instance allows the SDK to cache decisions and configuration to
improve performance.

### Rule modes

Each rule can be configured in either `LIVE` or `DRY_RUN` mode. When in
`DRY_RUN` mode, each rule will return its decision, but the end conclusion will
always be `ALLOW`.

This allows you to run Arcjet in passive / demo mode to test rules before
enabling them. Arcjet will log what it would have done.

### Environment variables

The following environment variables can be used to configure the SDK at runtime:

- `ARCJET_BASE_URL` - Will override the decision API which the SDK communicates
  with. This defaults to `https://decide.arcjet.com` and should only be changed
  if directed by Arcjet support.
- `ARCJET_LOG_LEVEL` - The log level to use, either `debug`, `info`, `warn`, or
  `error`. Defaults to `warn`. If a rule is in dry run mode, a warning will be
  output with the decision that would have been applied.
- `ARCJET_ENV` - Set to `development` to force Arcjet into development mode.
  This will allow private/internal addresses so that the SDKs work correctly
  locally. You usually do not need to set this because it uses `NODE_ENV` when
  set. See
  [Troubleshooting](/troubleshooting#generatefingerprint-ip-is-empty--failed_precondition-client-ip-not-provided)
  for when this may be needed.

### Custom logging

The Arcjet SDK can be integrated into the [NestJS
logger](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/logger). You should define an
interface to extend the built-in logger and then use this within your
controllers.

<Code code={LoggerTS} lang="ts" title="src/app.module.ts" />

## Decision

Arcjet can be integrated into NestJS in several places:

- **Global guard:** Applies Arcjet rules on every request, but does not allow
  you to configure rules per route. The `protect` function is called for you
  inside the guard and you can't access the response.
- **Per route guard:** Allows you to configure rules per route, but requires you
  to add the guard to every route and has limited flexibility. The `protect`
  function is called for you inside the guard and you can't access the response.
- **Within route:** Requires some code duplication, but allows maximum
  flexibility because you can customize the rules and response. You call the
  `protect` function directly in the controller and can access the return
  `Promise` that resolves to an `ArcjetDecision` object.

The decision available when you call `protect` directly contains the following
properties:

- `id` (`string`) - The unique ID for the request. This can be used to look up
  the request in the Arcjet dashboard. It is prefixed with `req_` for decisions
  involving the Arcjet cloud API. For decisions taken locally, the prefix is
  `lreq_`.
- `conclusion` (`"ALLOW" | "DENY" | "CHALLENGE" | "ERROR"`) - The final
  conclusion based on evaluating each of the configured rules. If you wish to
  accept Arcjet's recommended action based on the configured rules then you can
  use this property.
- `reason` (`ArcjetReason`) - An object containing more detailed
  information about the conclusion.
- `results` (`ArcjetRuleResult[]`) - An array of `ArcjetRuleResult` objects
  containing the results of each rule that was executed.
- `ttl` (`uint32`) - The time-to-live for the decision in seconds. This is the
  time that the decision is valid for. After this time, the decision will be
  re-evaluated. The SDK automatically caches `DENY` decisions for the length of
  the TTL.
- `requestAnalysis` (`ArcjetRequestAnalysis`) - An object containing Arcjet's
  analysis of the request and client. This includes details about the type of IP
  and country. See below for more information.

### Conclusion

The `ArcjetDecision` object has the following methods that should be used to
check the conclusion:

- `isAllowed()` (`bool`) - The request should be allowed.
- `isDenied()` (`bool`) - The request should be denied.
- `isErrored()` (`bool`) - There was an unrecoverable error.

### Reason

The `reason` property of the `ArcjetDecision` object contains an `ArcjetReason`
object which provides more detailed information about the conclusion. This is
the final decision reason and is based on the configured rules.

The `ArcjetReason` object has the following methods that can be used to check
which rule caused the conclusion:

- `isBot()` (`bool`) - Returns `true` if the bot protection rules have been
  applied and the request was considered to have been made by a bot.
- `isEmail()` (`bool`) - Returns `true` if the email rules have been applied and
  the email address has a problem.
- `isRateLimit()` (`bool`) - Returns `true` if the rate limit rules have been
  applied and the request has exceeded the rate limit.
- `isSensitiveInfo()` (`bool`) - Returns `true` if sensitive info rules have
  been applied and sensitive info has been detected.
- `isShield()` (`bool`) - Returns `true` if the shield rules have been applied
  and the request is suspicious based on analysis by Arcjet Shield.
- `isError()` (`bool`) - Returns `true` if there was an error processing the
  request.

### Results

The `results` property of the `ArcjetDecision` object contains an array of
`ArcjetRuleResult` objects. There will be one for each configured rule so you
can inspect the individual results:

- `id` (`string`) - The ID of the rule result. Not yet implemented.
- `state` (`ArcjetRuleState`) - Whether the rule was executed or not.
- `conclusion` (`ArcjetConclusion`) - The conclusion of the rule. This will be
  one of the above conclusions: `ALLOW`, `DENY`, `CHALLENGE`, or `ERROR`.
- `reason` (`ArcjetReason`) - An object containing more detailed information
  about the conclusion for this rule. Each rule type has its own reason object
  with different properties.

You can iterate through the results and check the conclusion for each rule.

```ts
for (const result of decision.results) {
  this.logger.log("Rule Result", result);
}
```

#### Rule state

The `state` property of the `ArcjetRuleResult` object is an `ArcjetRuleState`.
Each rule is evaluated individually and can be in one of the following states:

- `DRY_RUN` - The rule was executed in dry run mode. This means that the rule
  was executed but the conclusion was not applied to the request. This is useful
  for testing rules before enabling them.
- `RUN` - The rule was executed and the conclusion was applied to the request.
- `NOT_RUN` - The rule was not executed. This can happen if another rule has
  already reached a conclusion that applies to the request. For example, if a
  rate limit rule is configured then these are evaluated before all other rules.
  If the client has reached the maximum number of requests then other rules will
  not be evaluated.
- `CACHED` - The rule was not executed because the previous result was cached.
  Results are cached when the decision conclusion is `DENY`. Subsequent requests
  from the same client will not be evaluated against the rule until the cache
  expires.

#### Rule reason

The `reason` property of the `ArcjetRuleResult` object contains an
`ArcjetReason` object which provides more detailed information about the
conclusion for that configured rule.

##### Shield

The `ArcjetReason` object for shield rules has the following properties:

```ts
shieldTriggered: boolean;
```

See the [shield documentation](/shield/reference?f=remix) for more information
about these properties.

##### Bot protection

The `ArcjetReason` object for bot protection rules has the following properties:

```ts
allowed: string[];
denied: string[];
```

Each of the `allowed` and `denied` arrays contains the identifiers of the bots
allowed or denied from our [full list of bots](https://arcjet.com/bot-list).

##### Rate limiting

The `ArcjetReason` object for rate limiting rules has the following properties:

```ts
max: number;
remaining: number;
window: number;
reset: number;
```

See the [rate limiting documentation](/rate-limiting/reference?f=node-js) for more
information about these properties.

##### Email validation & verification

The `ArcjetReason` object for email rules has the following properties:

```ts
emailTypes: ArcjetEmailType[];
```

An `ArcjetEmailType` is one of the following strings:

```ts
"DISPOSABLE" | "FREE" | "NO_MX_RECORDS" | "NO_GRAVATAR" | "INVALID";
```

See the [email validation documentation](/email-validation/reference?f=node-js) for more
information about these properties.

### IP analysis

As of SDK version `1.0.0-alpha.11`, the `ArcjetDecision` object contains an `ip`
property. This includes additional data about the client IP address:

#### IP location

The IP location fields may be `undefined`, but you can use various methods to
check their availability. Using the methods will also refine the type to remove
the need for null or undefined checks.

- `hasLatitude()` (`bool`): returns whether the `latitude` and `accuracyRadius`
  fields are available.
- `hasLongitude()` (`bool`): returns whether the `longitude` and
  `accuracyRadius` fields are available.
- `hasAccuracyRadius()` (`bool`): returns whether the `longitude`, `latitude`,
  and `accuracyRadius` fields are available.
- `hasTimezone()` (`bool`): returns whether the `timezone` field is available.
- `hasPostalCode()` (`bool`): returns whether the `postalCode` field is
  available.
- `hasCity()` (`bool`): returns whether the `city` field is available.
- `hasRegion()` (`bool`): returns whether the `region` field is available.
- `hasCountry()` (`bool`): returns whether the `country` and `countryName`
  fields are available.
- `hasContinent()` (`bool`): returns whether the `continent` and `continentName`
  fields are available.
- `latitude` (`number | undefined`): the latitude of the client IP address.
- `longitude` (`number | undefined`): the longitude of the client IP address.
- `accuracyRadius` (`number | undefined`): how accurate the location is in
  kilometers.
- `timezone` (`string | undefined`): the timezone of the client IP address.
- `postalCode` (`string | undefined`): the postal or zip code of the client IP
  address.
- `city` (`string | undefined`): the city of the client IP address.
- `region` (`string | undefined`): the region of the client IP address.
- `country` (`string | undefined`): the country code the client IP address.
- `countryName` (`string | undefined`): the country name of the client IP
  address.
- `continent` (`string | undefined`): the continent code of the client IP
  address.
- `continentName` (`string | undefined`): the continent name of the client IP
  address.

##### Location accuracy

IP geolocation can be notoriously inaccurate, especially for mobile devices,
satellite internet providers, and even just normal users. Likewise with the
specific fields like `city` and `region`, which can be very inaccurate. Country
is usually accurate, but there are often cases where IP addresses are
mis-located. These fields are provided for convenience e.g. suggesting a user
location, but should not be relied upon by themselves.

#### IP AS

This is useful for identifying the network operator of the client IP address.
This is useful for understanding whether the client is likely to be automated or
not, or being stricter with requests from certain networks.

The IP AS fields may be `undefined`, but you can use the `hasASN()` method to
check their availability. Using this method will also refine the type to remove
the need for null-ish checks.

- `hasASN()` (`bool`): returns whether all of the ASN fields are available.
- `asn` (`string | undefined`): the autonomous system (AS) number of the client
  IP address.
- `asnName` (`string | undefined`): the name of the AS of the client IP address.
- `asnDomain` (`string | undefined`): the domain of the AS of the client IP
  address.
- `asnType` (`'isp' | 'hosting' | 'business' | 'education'`): the type of the AS
  of the client IP address. Real users are more likely to be on an ISP or
  business network rather than a hosting provider. Education networks often have
  a single or small number of IP addresses even though there are many users. A
  common mistake is to block a single IP because of too many requests when it is
  a university or company network using
  [NAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-grade_NAT) (Network Address
  Translation) to give many users the same IP.
- `asnCountry` (`string | undefined`): the country code of the AS of the client
  IP address. This is the administrative country of the AS, not necessarily the
  country of the client IP address.

#### IP type

The `service` field may be `undefined`, but you can use the `hasService()`
method to check the availability. Using this method will also refine the type to
remove the need for null-ish checks.

- `hasService()` (`bool`): whether the `service` field is available.
- `service` (`string | undefined`): the name of the service associated with the
  IP address—e.g. `Apple Private Relay`.
- `isHosting()` (`bool`): returns whether the IP address of the client is owned
  by a hosting provider. Requests originating from a hosting provider IP
  significantly increase the likelihood that this is an automated client.
- `isVpn()` (`bool`): returns whether the IP address of the client is owned by a
  VPN provider. Many people use VPNs for privacy or work purposes, so by itself
  this is not an indicator of the client being automated. However, it does
  increase the risk score of the client and depending on your use case it may be
  a characteristic you wish to restrict.
- `isProxy()` (`bool`): returns whether the IP address of the client is owned by
  a proxy provider. Similar to `isVpn()`, but proxies are more likely to involve
  automated traffic.
- `isTor()` (`bool`): returns whether the IP address of the client is known to
  be part of the Tor network. As with `isVpn()`, there are legitimate uses for
  hiding your identity through Tor, however it is also often a way to hide the
  origin of malicious traffic.
- `isRelay()` (`bool`): returns whether the IP address of the client is owned by
  a relay service. The most common example is Apple iCloud Relay, which
  indicates the client is less likely to be automated because Apple requires a
  paid subscription linked to an Apple account in good standing.

#### Example

<Code code={IPLocationTS} lang="ts" />

For the IP address `8.8.8.8` you might get the following response. Only the
fields we have data for will be returned:

```json
{
  "name": "Hello United States!",
  "ip": {
    "country": "US",
    "countryName": "United States",
    "continent": "NA",
    "continentName": "North America",
    "asn": "AS15169",
    "asnName": "Google LLC",
    "asnDomain": "google.com"
  }
}
```

## Error handling

Arcjet is designed to fail open so that a service issue or misconfiguration does
not block all requests. The SDK will also time out and fail open after 1000ms
when `NODE_ENV` or `ARCJET_ENV` is `development` and 500ms otherwise. However,
in most cases, the response time will be less than 20-30ms.

If there is an error condition, Arcjet will return an `ERROR` `conclusion`.

```ts
if (decision.isErrored()) {
  if (decision.reason.message.includes("missing User-Agent header")) {
    // Requests without User-Agent headers can not be identified as any
    // particular bot and will be marked as an errored decision. Most
    // legitimate clients always send this header, so we recommend blocking
    // requests without it.
    this.logger.warn("User-Agent header is missing");
    throw new HttpException("Bad request", HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST);
  } else {
    // Fail open to prevent an Arcjet error from blocking all requests. You
    // may want to fail closed if this controller is very sensitive
    this.logger.error(`Arcjet error: ${decision.reason.message}`);
    //throw new HttpException("Service unavailable", HttpStatus.SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE);
  }
}
```

## IP address detection

Arcjet will automatically detect the IP address of the client making the request
based on the context provided. The implementation is open source in our
[@arcjet/ip package](https://github.com/arcjet/arcjet-js/blob/main/ip).

In development environments (`NODE_ENV === "development"` or
`ARCJET_ENV === "development"`), we allow private/internal addresses so that the
SDKs work correctly locally.
