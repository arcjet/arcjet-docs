[<SDKVersionNextjs/>](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arcjet/next)

This is the reference guide for the Arcjet Next.js SDK, [available on
GitHub](https://github.com/arcjet/arcjet-js) and licensed under the Apache 2.0
license.

<WhatIsArcjet />

## Installation

In your project root, run the following command to install the SDK:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Tabs>
<TabItem label="npm">
```sh
npm i @arcjet/next
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">
```sh
pnpm add @arcjet/next
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="yarn">
```sh
yarn add @arcjet/next
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Requirements

<Requirements />

## Quick start

Check out the [quick start guide](/get-started?f=next-js).

## Configuration

Create a new `Arcjet` object with your API key and rules. This should be outside
of the request handler.

The required fields are:

- `key` (`string`) - Your Arcjet site key. This can be found in the SDK
  Installation section for the site in the [Arcjet
  Dashboard](https://app.arcjet.com).
- `rules` - The rules to apply to the request. See the various sections of the
  docs for how to configure these e.g. [shield](/shield/reference?f=next-js), [rate
  limiting](/rate-limiting/reference?f=next-js), [bot
  protection](/bot-protection/reference?f=next-js), [email
  validation](/email-validation/reference?f=next-js).

The optional fields are:

- `characteristics` (`string[]`) - A list of
  [characteristics](/architecture#built-in-characteristics) to be used to
  uniquely identify clients.
- `proxies` (`string[]`) - A list of one or more trusted proxies. These
  addresses will be excluded when Arcjet is determining the client IP address.
  This is useful if you are behind a load balancer or proxy that sets the client
  IP address in a header. See [Load balancers &
  proxies](#load-balancers--proxies) below for an example.

  <TabItem label="TS">
    <Code code={ConfigurationTS} lang="ts" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="JS">
    <Code code={ConfigurationJS} lang="js" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Single instance

We recommend creating a single instance of the `Arcjet` object and reusing it
throughout your application. This is because the SDK caches decisions and
configuration to improve performance.

The pattern we use is to create a utility file that exports the `Arcjet` object
and then import it where you need it. See [our example Next.js
app](https://github.com/arcjet/example-nextjs/blob/main/lib/arcjet.ts) for how
this is done.

### Rule modes

Each rule can be configured in either `LIVE` or `DRY_RUN` mode. When in
`DRY_RUN` mode, each rule will return its decision, but the end conclusion will
always be `ALLOW`.

This allows you to run Arcjet in passive / demo mode to test rules before
enabling them. Arcjet will log what it would have done.

```ts
import arcjet, { fixedWindow } from "@arcjet/next";

const aj = arcjet({
  key: process.env.ARCJET_KEY,
  characteristics: ["ip.src"],
  rules: [
    fixedWindow(
      // This rule is live
      {
        mode: "LIVE",
        window: "1h",
        max: 60,
      },
      // This rule is in dry run mode, so will log but not block
      {
        mode: "DRY_RUN",
        characteristics: ['http.request.headers["x-api-key"]'],
        window: "1h",
        // max could also be a dynamic value applied after looking up a limit
        // elsewhere e.g. in a database for the authenticated user
        max: 600,
      },
    ),
  ],
});
```

### Multiple rules

You can combine rules to create a more complex protection strategy. For example,
you can combine rate limiting and bot protection rules to protect your API from
automated clients.

:::note
When specifying multiple rules, the order of the rules is ignored. Rule
execution ordering is automatically optimized for performance.

    <Code code={MultipleRulesJS} title="index.js" lang="js" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Environment variables

The following environment variables can be used to configure the SDK at runtime:

- `ARCJET_BASE_URL` - Will override the decision API which the SDK communicates
  with. This defaults to `https://decide.arcjet.com` and should only be changed
  if directed by Arcjet support.
- `ARCJET_LOG_LEVEL` - The log level to use, either `debug`, `info`, `warn`, or
  `error`. Defaults to `warn`. If a rule is in dry run mode, a warning will be
  output with the decision that would have been applied.
- `ARCJET_ENV` - Set to `development` to force Arcjet into development mode.
  This will allow private/internal addresses so that the SDKs work correctly
  locally. You usually do not need to set this because it uses `NODE_ENV` when
  set. See
  [Troubleshooting](/troubleshooting#generatefingerprint-ip-is-empty--failed_precondition-client-ip-not-provided)
  for when this may be needed.

### Custom logging

The SDK uses a lightweight logger which mirrors the
[Pino](https://github.com/pinojs/pino) [structured
logger](https://github.com/pinojs/pino/blob/8db130eba0439e61c802448d31eb1998cebfbc98/docs/api.md#logger)
interface. You can use this to customize the logging output.

First, install the required packages:

```shell
npm install pino pino-pretty
```

Then, create a custom logger that will log to JSON in production and pretty
print in development:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="TS">
    <Code code={LoggerTS} title="/app/api/route/hello.ts" lang="ts" mark={28} />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="JS">
    <Code code={LoggerJS} title="/app/api/route/hello.js" lang="js" mark={28} />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Finally, Next.js
[requires](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/46987#discussioncomment-8464812)
marking Pino as an external package in your Next.js config file:

```js title="next.config.js"
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  experimental: {
    // https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/46987#discussioncomment-8464812
    serverComponentsExternalPackages: ["pino", "pino-pretty"],
  },
};

module.exports = nextConfig;
```

### Load balancers & proxies

If your application is behind a load balancer, Arcjet will only see the IP
address of the load balancer and not the real client IP address.

To fix this, most load balancers will set the `X-Forwarded-For` header with the
real client IP address plus a list of proxies that the request has passed
through.

The problem with is that the `X-Forwarded-For` header can be spoofed by the
client, so you should only trust it if you are sure that the load balancer is
setting it correctly. See [the MDN
docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-For)
for more details.

You can configure Arcjet to trust IP addresses in the `X-Forwarded-For` header
by setting the `proxies` field in the configuration. This should be a list of
the IP addresses of your load balancers to be removed, so that the last IP
address in the list is the real client IP address.

#### Example

For example, if the load balancer is at `100.100.100.100` and the client IP
address is `192.168.1.1`, the `X-Forwarded-For` header will be:

```http
X-Forwarded-For: 192.168.1.1, 100.100.100.100
```

You should set the `proxies` field to `["100.100.100.100"]` so Arcjet will use
`192.168.1.1` as the client IP address.

<Code code={ProxiesTS} lang="ts" />

## Protect

Arcjet provides a single `protect` function that is used to execute your
protection rules. This requires a `request` object which is the request
argument as passed to the Next.js request handler. Rules you add to the SDK may
require additional details, such as the `validateEmail` rule requiring an
additional `email` prop.

This function returns a `Promise` that resolves to an `ArcjetDecision` object,
which provides a high-level conclusion and detailed explanations of the decision
made by Arcjet.

    <Code code={ProtectAppTS} title="/app/api/route/hello.ts" lang="ts" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="TS (Pages)">
    <Code code={ProtectPagesTS} title="/pages/api/hello.ts" lang="ts" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="JS (App Router)">
    <Code code={ProtectAppJS} title="/app/api/route/hello.js" lang="js" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="JS (Pages Router)">
    <Code code={ProtectPagesJS} title="/pages/api/hello.js" lang="js" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Pages / Page components

Arcjet can protect Next.js pages that are server components (the default).
Client components cannot be protected because they run on the client side and do
not have access to the request object.

<Code code={PageComponent} title="app/page.tsx" lang="ts" />

### Server actions

Arcjet supports server actions in both Next.js 14 and 15 for all features except
sensitive data detection. You need to call a utility function `request()` that
accesses the headers we need to analyze the request.

For example:

#### Client component example

In this example the server action is [passed as a prop to a client
component](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations#client-components).

<Code code={ServerActionProp} title="app/actions.ts" lang="ts" />

```tsx title="app/ui/button.tsx"
"use client";

import { create } from "@/app/actions";

export function Button() {
  return <button onClick={() => create()}>Create</button>;
}
```

```tsx title="app/page.tsx"
import { Button } from "./ui/button";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button />
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Form example

In this example the server action is handling a form submission, based on [the
Next.js example form
handler](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations#forms).

These examples will `throw` when there is an error
([docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations#error-handling)),
but you can use
[`useFormState`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations#server-side-form-validation)
to return errors to the form. If you are using React 19, use
[`useActionState`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useActionState) instead.

<Code code={ServerAction} title="app/invoices/page.tsx" lang="ts" />

## Decision

The `protect` function function returns a `Promise` that resolves to an
`ArcjetDecision` object. This contains the following properties:

- `id` (`string`) - The unique ID for the request. This can be used to look up
  the request in the Arcjet dashboard. It is prefixed with `req_` for decisions
  involving the Arcjet cloud API. For decisions taken locally, the prefix is
  `lreq_`.
- `conclusion` (`"ALLOW" | "DENY" | "CHALLENGE" | "ERROR"`) - The final
  conclusion based on evaluating each of the configured rules. If you wish to
  accept Arcjet's recommended action based on the configured rules then you can
  use this property.
- `reason` (`ArcjetReason`) - An object containing more detailed
  information about the conclusion.
- `results` (`ArcjetRuleResult[]`) - An array of `ArcjetRuleResult` objects
  containing the results of each rule that was executed.
- `ttl` (`uint32`) - The time-to-live for the decision in seconds. This is the
  time that the decision is valid for. After this time, the decision will be
  re-evaluated. The SDK automatically caches `DENY` decisions for the length of
  the TTL.
- `ip` (`ArcjetIpDetails`) - An object containing Arcjet's analysis of the
  client IP address. See IP analysis below for more information.

### Conclusion

The `ArcjetDecision` object has the following methods that should be used to
check the conclusion:

- `isAllowed()` (`bool`) - The request should be allowed.
- `isDenied()` (`bool`) - The request should be denied.
- `isErrored()` (`bool`) - There was an unrecoverable error.

### Reason

The `reason` property of the `ArcjetDecision` object contains an `ArcjetReason`
object which provides more detailed information about the conclusion. This is
the final decision reason and is based on the configured rules.

The `ArcjetReason` object has the following methods that can be used to check
which rule caused the conclusion:

- `isBot()` (`bool`) - Returns `true` if the bot protection rules have been
  applied and the request was considered to have been made by a bot.
- `isEmail()` (`bool`) - Returns `true` if the email rules have been applied and
  the email address has a problem.
- `isRateLimit()` (`bool`) - Returns `true` if the rate limit rules have been
  applied and the request has exceeded the rate limit.
- `isSensitiveInfo()` (`bool`) - Returns `true` if sensitive info rules have
  been applied and sensitive info has been detected.
- `isShield()` (`bool`) - Returns `true` if the shield rules have been applied
  and the request is suspicious based on analysis by Arcjet Shield WAF.
- `isError()` (`bool`) - Returns `true` if there was an error processing the
  request.

### Results

The `results` property of the `ArcjetDecision` object contains an array of
`ArcjetRuleResult` objects. There will be one for each configured rule so you
can inspect the individual results:

- `id` (`string`) - The ID of the rule result. Not yet implemented.
- `state` (`ArcjetRuleState`) - Whether the rule was executed or not.
- `conclusion` (`ArcjetConclusion`) - The conclusion of the rule. This will be
  one of the above conclusions: `ALLOW`, `DENY`, `CHALLENGE`, or `ERROR`.
- `reason` (`ArcjetReason`) - An object containing more detailed information
  about the conclusion for this rule. Each rule type has its own reason object
  with different properties.

You can iterate through the results and check the conclusion for each rule.

```ts
for (const result of decision.results) {
  console.log("Rule Result", result);
}
```

This example will log the full result as well as each rate limit rule:

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="JS (Pages Router)">
    <Code code={DecisionLogPagesJS} title="/pages/api/hello.js" lang="js" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Rule state

The `state` property of the `ArcjetRuleResult` object is an `ArcjetRuleState`.
Each rule is evaluated individually and can be in one of the following states:

- `DRY_RUN` - The rule was executed in dry run mode. This means that the rule
  was executed but the conclusion was not applied to the request. This is useful
  for testing rules before enabling them.
- `RUN` - The rule was executed and the conclusion was applied to the request.
- `NOT_RUN` - The rule was not executed. This can happen if another rule has
  already reached a conclusion that applies to the request. For example, if a
  rate limit rule is configured then these are evaluated before all other rules.
  If the client has reached the maximum number of requests then other rules will
  not be evaluated.
- `CACHED` - The rule was not executed because the previous result was cached.
  Results are cached when the decision conclusion is `DENY`. Subsequent requests
  from the same client will not be evaluated against the rule until the cache
  expires.

#### Rule reason

The `reason` property of the `ArcjetRuleResult` object contains an
`ArcjetReason` object which provides more detailed information about the
conclusion for that configured rule.

##### Shield

The `ArcjetReason` object for shield rules has the following properties:

```ts
shieldTriggered: boolean;
```

See the [shield documentation](/shield/reference?f=next-js) for more information
about these properties.

##### Bot protection

The `ArcjetReason` object for bot protection rules has the following properties:

```ts
allowed: string[];
denied: string[];
```

Each of the `allowed` and `denied` arrays contains the identifiers of the bots
allowed or denied from our [full list of bots](https://arcjet.com/bot-list).

##### Rate limiting

The `ArcjetReason` object for rate limiting rules has the following properties:

```ts
max: number;
remaining: number;
window: number;
reset: number;
```

See the [rate limiting documentation](/rate-limiting/reference?f=next-js) for more
information about these properties.

##### Email validation & verification

The `ArcjetReason` object for email rules has the following properties:

```ts
emailTypes: ArcjetEmailType[];
```

An `ArcjetEmailType` is one of the following strings:

```ts
"DISPOSABLE" | "FREE" | "NO_MX_RECORDS" | "NO_GRAVATAR" | "INVALID";
```

See the [email validation documentation](/email-validation/reference?f=next-js) for
more information about these properties.

### IP analysis

<IPAnalysis />

#### Example

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="TS (App)">
    <Code code={IPLocationAppTS} title="/app/api/route/hello.ts" lang="ts" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="TS (Pages)">
    <Code code={IPLocationPagesTS} title="/pages/api/hello.ts" lang="ts" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="JS (App Router)">
    <Code code={IPLocationAppJS} title="/app/api/route/hello.js" lang="js" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="JS (Pages Router)">
    <Code code={IPLocationPagesJS} title="/pages/api/hello.js" lang="js" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

For the IP address `8.8.8.8` you might get the following response. Only the
fields we have data for will be returned:

```json
{
  "name": "Hello United States!",
  "ip": {
    "country": "US",
    "countryName": "United States",
    "continent": "NA",
    "continentName": "North America",
    "asn": "AS15169",
    "asnName": "Google LLC",
    "asnDomain": "google.com"
  }
}
```

## Error handling

Arcjet is designed to fail open so that a service issue or misconfiguration does
not block all requests. The SDK will also time out and fail open after 1000ms
when `NODE_ENV` or `ARCJET_ENV` is `development` and 500ms otherwise. However,
in most cases, the response time will be less than 20-30ms.

If there is an error condition, Arcjet will return an `ERROR` `conclusion`.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Ad hoc rules

Sometimes it is useful to add additional protection via a rule based on the
logic in your handler; however, you usually want to inherit the rules, cache,
and other configuration from our primary SDK. This can be achieved using the
`withRule` function which accepts an ad-hoc rule and can be chained to add
multiple rules. It returns an augmented client with the specialized `protect`
function.

    <Code code={WithRuleAppTS} title="/app/api/route/hello.ts" lang="ts" />

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="JS (Pages Router)">
    <Code code={WithRulePagesJS} title="/pages/api/hello.js" lang="js" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## IP address detection

Arcjet will automatically detect the IP address of the client making the request
based on the context provided. The implementation is open source in our
[@arcjet/ip package](https://github.com/arcjet/arcjet-js/blob/main/ip).

In development environments (`NODE_ENV === "development"` or
`ARCJET_ENV === "development"`), we allow private/internal addresses so that the
SDKs work correctly locally.

## Client override

The default client can be overridden. If no client is specified, a default one
will be used. Generally you should not need to provide a client - the Arcjet
Next.js SDK will automatically handle this for you, including when using the
[Edge Runtime](https://edge-runtime.vercel.app).

## Version support

### Node

<NodeVersions />

### Next.js

Arcjet supports the current and previous major versions of Next.js for both the
app router and pages router. When a new major version of Next.js is released, we
will bump the major version of the Arcjet SDK.

- Previous supported major version: Next.js 14.x
- Current supported major version: Next.js 15.x

The pages router will be supported for as long as Next.js supports it.

[Technical support](/support) is provided for the current major
version of the Arcjet SDK for all users and for the current and previous major
versions for paid users. We will provide security fixes for the current and
previous major versions.
