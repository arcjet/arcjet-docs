This guide shows how to use the package
[`@arcjet/react-router`][npmjs-arcjet-react-router].
Its source code is [on GitHub][github-arcjet-react-router].
The code is open source and licensed under Apache 2.0.

## Quick start

See the [React Router quick start][arcjet-quick-start-react-router].

## Requirements

- React Router 7 or later
- Node.js 20 or later, or similar runtime
- ESM

## Install

<SelectableContent client:load syncKey="packageManager">
  <Fragment slotIdx="1" slot="npm">

    ```sh
    npm install @arcjet/react-router
    ```

  </Fragment>

  <Fragment slotIdx="2" slot="pnpm">

    ```sh
    pnpm add @arcjet/react-router
    ```

  </Fragment>

  <Fragment slotIdx="3" slot="yarn">

    ```sh
    yarn add @arcjet/react-router
    ```

  </Fragment>

## Use

### Configure

Build Arcjet clients as few times as possible.
That means _outside_ request handlers.
If you need different strategies, such as one for logged-in users and one for
guests,
create two clients and choose which one to use inside the handler.

#### Options

The main way to configure Arcjet is to pass options to the `arcjet` function.
The required fields are:

- `key` (`string`)
  — API key to identify the site in Arcjet
  (typically through `process.env.ARCJET_KEY`)
- `rules` (`Array<ArcjetRule>`)
  — rules to use (order insensitive)

For all available fields,
see [`ArcjetOptions` in the readme][api-arcjet-options].

Get your site key from the [Arcjet dashboard][arcjet-app].
Set it as an environment variable called `ARCJET_KEY` in your `.env` file:

```sh
ARCJET_KEY=your_site_key_here
```

#### Environment variables

Next to the convention of using `ARCJET_KEY` for the Arcjet Cloud API key,
there are several environment variables that affect how Arcjet works.

- `ARCJET_BASE_URL`
  — an allowed URL to the Cloud API
  (defaults to `https://decide.arcjet.com`)
- `ARCJET_ENV`, `MODE`, `NODE_ENV`
  — whether development mode is on
- `ARCJET_LOG_LEVEL`
  — log level to use
- `FLY_APP_NAME`, `VERCEL`, `RENDER`
  — hosting platform

### Protect

Use the [`protect`][api-protect] function to protect a request from React
Router.
Some rules, such as `validateEmail`, may need extra properties.
The protect function returns a promise that resolves to a decision.

<SelectableContent client:load syncKey="language">
  <Fragment slotIdx="1" slot="JS">

    <Code code={ProtectJsx} lang="jsx" title="app/routes/home.jsx" />

  </Fragment>

  <Fragment slotIdx="2" slot="TS">

    <Code code={removeComments(ProtectTsx)} lang="tsx" title="app/routes/home.tsx" />

  </Fragment>
</SelectableContent>

### Decision

The `ArcjetDecision` that `protect` resolves to has the following fields:

- `conclusion` (`"ALLOW"`, `"DENY"`, or `"ERROR"`)
  — what to do with the request
- `id` (`string`)
  — ID for the request;
  local decisions start with `lreq_` and remote ones with `req_`
- `ip` (`ArcjetIpDetails`)
  — analysis of the client IP address
- `reason` (`ArcjetReason`)
  — more info about the conclusion
- `results` (`Array<ArcjetRuleResult>`)
  — results of each rule
- `ttl` (`number`)
  — time-to-live for the decision in seconds;
  `"DENY"` decisions are cached by `@arcjet/react-router` for this duration

This top-level decision takes the results from each `"LIVE"` rule into account.
If one of them is `"DENY"` then the overall conclusion will be `"DENY"`.
Otherwise, if one of them is `"ERROR"`, then `"ERROR"`.
Otherwise, it will be `"ALLOW"`.
The `reason` and `ttl` fields reflect this conclusion.

To illustrate,
when a bot rule returns an error and a validate email rule returns a deny,
the overall conclusion is `"DENY"`,
while the `"ERROR"` is available in the results.

The results of `"DRY_RUN"` rules do not affect this overall decision,
but are included in `results`.

The `ip` field is available when the Cloud API was called and contains
IP geolocation and reputation info.
You can use this field to customize responses or you can use
[filter rules][arcjet-filter-rules] to make decisions based on it.
See the
[IP geolocation][arcjet-blueprint-ip-geolocation] and
[IP reputation][arcjet-blueprint-vpn-proxy-detection]
blueprints for more info.

## Errors

Arcjet fails open so that a service issue, misconfiguration, or
[network timeout][arcjet-architecture-timeout] does not block requests.
Such errors should in many cases be logged but otherwise treated as `"ALLOW"`
decisions.
The `reason.message` field has more info on what occured.

<SelectableContent client:load syncKey="language">
  <Fragment slotIdx="1" slot="JS">

    <Code code={ErrorJs} lang="js" title="app/routes/home.jsx" />

  </Fragment>

  <Fragment slotIdx="2" slot="TS">

    <Code code={removeComments(ErrorTs)} lang="ts" title="app/routes/home.tsx" />

  </Fragment>
</SelectableContent>

## Custom logs

You can use a custom log interface matching [`pino`][github-pino]
to change the default behavior.
Using `pino-pretty` as an example:

<SelectableContent client:load syncKey="packageManager">
  <Fragment slotIdx="1" slot="npm">

    ```sh
    npm install pino pino-pretty
    ```

  </Fragment>

  <Fragment slotIdx="2" slot="pnpm">

    ```sh
    pnpm add pino pino-pretty
    ```

  </Fragment>

  <Fragment slotIdx="3" slot="yarn">

    ```sh
    yarn add pino pino-pretty
    ```

  </Fragment>
</SelectableContent>

Then, create a custom logger that will log to JSON in production and pretty
print in development:

<Code code={CustomLog} lang="js" />

## Custom client

You can pass a client to change the behavior when connecting to the Cloud API.
Use [`createRemoteClient`][api-create-remote-client] to create a client.

<Code code={CustomClientJs} lang="js" />
