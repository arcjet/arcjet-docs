This guide will help you protect your [Hono +
Node.js](https://hono.dev/getting-started/nodejs) app using Arcjet.

## SDK installation

Follow these steps to get started:. You can also [find an example app on
GitHub](https://github.com/arcjet/arcjet-js/tree/main/examples/nodejs-hono-rl).

### 1. Install Arcjet

In your project root, run the following command to install the SDK:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Tabs>
<TabItem label="npm">
```sh
npm i @arcjet/node
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">
```sh
pnpm add @arcjet/node
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="yarn">
```sh
yarn add @arcjet/node
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Requirements

- Node.js 18 or later
- Hono 4.3 or later
- CommonJS is not supported. Arcjet is ESM only.

### 2. Set your key

[Create a free Arcjet account](https://app.arcjet.com) then follow the
instructions to add a site and get a key. Add it to a `.env.local` file in your
project root.

Arcjet only accepts non-local IP addresses with a fallback to 127.0.0.1 in
development mode. Since Node.js doesn't set `NODE_ENV` for you, you also need to
set `ARCJET_ENV` in your environment file.

```ini title=".env.local"
# NODE_ENV is not set automatically, so tell Arcjet we're in dev
# You can leave this unset in prod
ARCJET_ENV=development
# Get your site key from https://app.arcjet.com
ARCJET_KEY=ajkey_yourkey
```

We instantiate the Arcjet client outside of the request context so it only needs
to be loaded once, however [Hono only supports reading environment
variables](https://hono.dev/helpers/adapter#env) inside the request context. You
can adjust the `dev` command to read them in:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "tsx watch --env-file=.env.local src/index.ts"
  }
}
```

### 3. Add a rate limit to a route

The rate limit example below applies a token bucket rate limit rule to a route
where we identify the user based on their ID e.g. if they are logged in. The
bucket is configured with a maximum capacity of 10 tokens and refills by 5
tokens every 10 seconds. Each request consumes 5 tokens.

<Code code={NodeJSHono} lang="ts" title="src/index.ts" />

### 4. Start server

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```sh
npm run dev
````

Then make some requests to hit the rate limit:

```sh
curl http://localhost:3000
```

## What next?

Arcjet can be used with specific rules on individual routes or as general
protection on your entire application. You can customize bot protection, rate
limiting for your API and minimize fraudulent registrations with the signup form
protection.
