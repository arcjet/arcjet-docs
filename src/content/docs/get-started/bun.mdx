This guide will help you protect your Bun app using Arcjet.

<WhatIsArcjet />

## SDK installation

Follow these steps to get started. You can also [find an example app on
GitHub](https://github.com/arcjet/arcjet-js/tree/main/examples/bun-rl).

### 1. Install Arcjet

In your project root, run the following command to install the SDK:

```bash
bun add @arcjet/bun
```

### 2. Set your key

[Create a free Arcjet account](https://app.arcjet.com) then follow the
instructions to add a site and get a key. Add it to a `.env.local` file in your
Bun project root. `NODE_ENV` isn't set by default, so you also need to tell
Arcjet you're in development mode.

Arcjet only accept non-local IP addresses with a fallback to 127.0.0.1 in development mode, and since Bun
doesn't set `NODE_ENV` for you like Node.js does, you also need to set
`ARCJET_ENV` in your environment file.

```ini title=".env.local"
# NODE_ENV is not set by the environment, so tell Arcjet we're in dev
# You can leave this unset in prod
ARCJET_ENV=development
# Get your site key from https://app.arcjet.com
ARCJET_KEY=ajkey_yourkey
```

### 3. Add a rate limit to a route

The example below applies a token bucket rate limit rule to a route where we
identify the user based on their ID e.g. if they are logged in. The bucket is
configured with a maximum capacity of 10 tokens and refills by 5 tokens every 10
seconds. Each request consumes 5 tokens.

We also configure a Shield rule which adds protection against common attacks,
such as SQL injection.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### `Bun.serve()` support

While our documentation gives you examples using [Bun's default export Object
syntax](https://bun.sh/docs/api/http#object-syntax), it will also run if you
use `Bun.serve()` instead:

<Code code={Step3ServeTS} lang="ts" title="/index.ts" />

### 4. Start app

Start your app and load `http://localhost:3000`.

```bash
bun run --hot index.ts
```

Refresh the page a few times to trigger the rate limit. The requests will also
show up in the [Arcjet dashboard](https://app.arcjet.com). Note: If you load
this in a browser, you may see 2 requests - one for the page and one for a
favicon.

## What next?

Arcjet can be used with specific rules on individual routes or as general
protection on your entire application. You can customize bot protection, rate
limiting for your API and minimize fraudulent registrations with the signup form
protection.
