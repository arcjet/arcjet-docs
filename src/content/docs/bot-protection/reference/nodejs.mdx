Arcjet bot detection allows you to manage traffic by automated clients and bots.

## Configuration

Bot detection is configured by specifying the bot types you wish to block and
optional user agent patterns to add or remove from the bot detection list.

The configuration definition is:

```ts
type BotOptions = {
  mode?: "LIVE" | "DRY_RUN";
  block?: BotType[];
  patterns?: {
    add?: { [key: string]: BotType };
    remove?: string[];
  };
};
```

The `arcjet` client is configured with one or more `detectBot` rules which take
one or many `BotOptions`.

:::note
When specifying multiple rules, the order of the rules is ignored. Rule
execution ordering is automatically optimized for performance. See
[decision](#decision) below for details of examining the execution results.
:::

### Which bots to block?

Which bot types to block is configured by listing one or more types in the
`block` configuration block. The types are listed on the [bot
types](/bot-protection/bot-types) page.

### Adding bot detection rules

You can add additional bot detection rules to the `patterns` `add` configuration
property. Each rule is a regular expression that matches the user agent of the
bot plus a label to indicate what type of bot it is.

:::note
The current implementation only supports `AUTOMATED` bot types, while support for the other [bot
types](/bot-protection/bot-types) is on the roadmap.

### Removing bot detection rules

Arcjet includes a set of default matching rules to detect common bots. You can
remove any of these rules by listing them in the `patterns` `remove`
configuration property:

    <Code code={RemovingRulesTS} lang="ts" title="/middleware.ts" />

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Decision

The [quick start example](/bot-protection/quick-start/nodejs) will deny requests
that match the bot detection rules, immediately returning a response to the
client.

Arcjet also provides a single `protect` function that is used to execute your
protection rules. This requires a `request` argument which is the request
context as passed to the request handler.

This function returns a `Promise` that resolves to an
`ArcjetDecision` object. This contains the following properties:

- `id` (`string`) - The unique ID for the request. This can be used to look up
  the request in the Arcjet dashboard. It is prefixed with `req_` for decisions
  involving the Arcjet cloud API. For decisions taken locally, the prefix is
  `lreq_`.
- `conclusion` (`ArcjetConclusion`) - The final conclusion based on evaluating
  each of the configured rules. If you wish to accept Arcjet's recommended
  action based on the configured rules then you can use this property.
- `reason` (`ArcjetReason`) - An object containing more detailed
  information about the conclusion.
- `results` (`ArcjetRuleResult[]`) - An array of `ArcjetRuleResult` objects
  containing the results of each rule that was executed.
- `ip` (`ArcjetIpDetails`) - An object containing Arcjet's analysis of the
  client IP address. See [IP analysis](/reference/nodejs/#ip-analysis) in the
  SDK reference for more information.

See [the SDK reference](/reference/nodejs#results) for more details about the
rule results.

You check if a deny conclusion has been returned by a bot protection rule by
using `decision.isDenied()` and `decision.reason.isBot()` respectively.

You can iterate through the results and check whether a bot protection rule was
applied:

```ts
for (const result of decision.results) {
  console.log("Rule Result", result);
}
```

This example will log the full result as well as the bot protection rule:

### Bot type

Arcjet also returns more information about the [bot
type](/bot-protection/bot-types) of the client we think made the request:

    <Code code={BotTypeTS} lang="ts" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="JS">
    <Code code={BotTypeJS} lang="js" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Error handling

Arcjet is designed to fail open so that a service issue or misconfiguration does
not block all requests. The SDK will also time out and fail open after 500ms
when `NODE_ENV` is `production` and 1000ms otherwise. However, in most cases,
the response time will be less than 20-30ms.

If there is an error condition, Arcjet will return an
`ERROR` type and you can check the `reason` property for more information, like
accessing `decision.reason.message`.
