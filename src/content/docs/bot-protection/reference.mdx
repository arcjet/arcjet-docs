Arcjet bot detection allows you to manage traffic by automated clients and bots.

## Configuration

Bot detection is configured by allowing or denying a subset of bots. The `allow`
and `deny` lists are mutually-exclusive, such that using `allow` will result in
a `DENY` decision for any detected bot that is not specified in the `allow` list
and using `deny` will result in an `ALLOW` decision for any detected bot that is
not specified in the `deny` list.

You can use only one of the following configuration definitions:

```ts
type BotOptionsAllow = {
  mode?: "LIVE" | "DRY_RUN";
  allow: Array<ArcjetWellKnownBot | ArcjetBotCategory>;
};
```

```ts
type BotOptionsDeny = {
  mode?: "LIVE" | "DRY_RUN";
  deny: Array<ArcjetWellKnownBot | ArcjetBotCategory>;
};
```

The `arcjet` client is configured with one or more `detectBot` rules which take
one or many `BotOptions`.

:::note
When specifying multiple rules, the order of the rules is ignored. Rule
execution ordering is automatically optimized for performance. See below for
how to examine the execution results.
:::

### Allowing specific bots

Most applications want to block almost all bots. However, it is common to allow
some bots to access your system, such as bots for search indexing or API
access from the command line.

This behavior is configured with an `allow` list from our [full list of
bots](https://arcjet.com/bot-list) and/or [bot
categories](/bot-protection/identifying-bots#bot-categories).

  <NodeJsAllowingBots slot="node-js" />
  <RemixAllowingBots slot="remix" />
  <SvelteKitAllowingBots slot="sveltekit" />
</SlotByFramework>

### Denying specific bots

Some applications may only want to block a small subset of bots, while allowing
the majority continued access. This may be due to many reasons, such as
misconfigured or high-traffic bots.

This behavior is configured with a `deny` list from our [full list of
bots](https://arcjet.com/bot-list) and/or [bot
categories](/bot-protection/identifying-bots#bot-categories).

</SlotByFramework>

## Decision

The [quick start example](/bot-protection/quick-start) will deny requests that
match the bot detection rules, immediately returning a response to the client.

Arcjet also provides a single `protect` function that is used to execute your
protection rules. This requires a `request` argument which is the request
context as passed to the request handler.

<TextByFramework framework="nest-js" client:load>
<br />
If you are using a global [guard](https://docs.nestjs.com/guards) or per route
guard then `protect` is called for you behind the scenes. If you add Arcjet
within a route then you call it directly.

</TextByFramework>
This function returns a `Promise` that resolves to an
`ArcjetDecision` object. This contains the following properties:

- `id` (`string`) - The unique ID for the request. This can be used to look up
  the request in the Arcjet dashboard. It is prefixed with `req_` for decisions
  involving the Arcjet cloud API. For decisions taken locally, the prefix is
  `lreq_`.
- `conclusion` (`ArcjetConclusion`) - The final conclusion based on evaluating
  each of the configured rules. If you wish to accept Arcjet's recommended
  action based on the configured rules then you can use this property.
- `reason` (`ArcjetReason`) - An object containing more detailed
  information about the conclusion.
- `results` (`ArcjetRuleResult[]`) - An array of `ArcjetRuleResult` objects
  containing the results of each rule that was executed.
- `ip` (`ArcjetIpDetails`) - An object containing Arcjet's analysis of the
  client IP address. See the SDK reference for more information.

You check if a deny conclusion has been returned by a bot protection rule by
using `decision.isDenied()` and `decision.reason.isBot()` respectively.

You can iterate through the results and check whether a bot protection rule was
applied:

```ts
for (const result of decision.results) {
  console.log("Rule Result", result);
}
```

  <DenoDecisionLog slot="deno" />
  <NestJsDecisionLog slot="nest-js" />
  <NextJsDecisionLog slot="next-js" />
  <NodeJsDecisionLog slot="node-js" />
  <RemixDecisionLog slot="remix" />
  <SvelteKitDecisionLog slot="sveltekit" />
</SlotByFramework>

### Identified bots

The decision also contains all of the [identified
bots and matched categories](/bot-protection/identifying-bots) detected from the
request. A request may be identified as zero, one, or more bots/categories—all
of which will be available on the `decision.allowed` and `decision.denied`
properties.

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <BunIdentifiedBots slot="bun" />
  <DenoIdentifiedBots slot="deno" />
  <NestJsIdentifiedBots slot="nest-js" />
  <NextJsIdentifiedBots slot="next-js" />
  <NodeJsIdentifiedBots slot="node-js" />
  <RemixIdentifiedBots slot="remix" />
  <SvelteKitIdentifiedBots slot="sveltekit" />
</SlotByFramework>

## Error handling

Arcjet is designed to fail open so that a service issue or misconfiguration does
not block all requests. The SDK will also time out and fail open after 1000ms
when `NODE_ENV` or `ARCJET_ENV` is `development` and 500ms otherwise. However,
in most cases, the response time will be less than 20-30ms.

If there is an error condition, Arcjet will return an
`ERROR` type and you can check the `reason` property for more information, like
accessing `decision.reason.message`.

:::note
Requests without `User-Agent` headers can not be identified as any particular
bot and will be marked as an errored decision. Check `decision.isErrored()` and
decide if you want to allow or deny the request. Our recommendation is to block
requests without `User-Agent` headers because most legitimate clients always
send this header.

See [an example of how to do this](/bot-protection/concepts#user-agent-header).

  <NextJsErrors slot="next-js" />
  <NodeJsErrors slot="node-js" />
  <RemixErrors slot="remix" />
  <SvelteKitErrors slot="sveltekit" />
</SlotByFramework>

## Filtering categories

All categories are also provided as enumerations, which allows for programmatic
access. For example, you may want to allow most of `CATEGORY:GOOGLE` except
their "advertising quality" bot.

  <BunFiltering slot="bun" />

  <NextJsFiltering slot="next-js" />
  <NodeJsFiltering slot="node-js" />
  <RemixFiltering slot="remix" />
  <SvelteKitFiltering slot="sveltekit" />
</SlotByFramework>

## Testing

Arcjet runs the same in any environment, including locally and in CI. You can
use the `mode` set to `DRY_RUN` to log the results of rule execution without
blocking any requests.

We have an example test framework you can use to automatically test your rules.
Arcjet can also be triggered based using a sample of your traffic.

See the [Testing](/testing) section of the docs for details.
