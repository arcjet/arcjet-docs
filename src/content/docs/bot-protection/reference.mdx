Arcjet bot detection allows you to manage traffic by automated clients and bots.

## Configuration

Bot detection is configured by allowing or denying a subset of bots. The `allow`
and `deny` lists are mutually-exclusive, such that using `allow` will result in
a `DENY` decision for any detected bot that is not specified in the `allow` list
and using `deny` will result in an `ALLOW` decision for any detected bot that is
not specified in the `deny` list.

You can use only one of the following configuration definitions:

```ts
type BotOptionsAllow = {
  mode?: "LIVE" | "DRY_RUN";
  allow: Array<ArcjetWellKnownBot | ArcjetBotCategory>;
};
```

```ts
type BotOptionsDeny = {
  mode?: "LIVE" | "DRY_RUN";
  deny: Array<ArcjetWellKnownBot | ArcjetBotCategory>;
};
```

The `arcjet` client is configured with one or more `detectBot` rules which take
one or many `BotOptions`.

:::note
When specifying multiple rules, the order of the rules is ignored. Rule
execution ordering is automatically optimized for performance. See below for
how to examine the execution results.

### Only allowing specific bots

Most applications want to block almost all bots. However, it is common to allow
some bots to access your system, such as bots for search indexing or API
access from the command line.

This behavior is configured with an `allow` list from our [full list of
bots](https://arcjet.com/bot-list) and/or [bot
categories](/bot-protection/identifying-bots#bot-categories).

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <AllowingBotsNextJs slot="next-js" />
  <AllowingBotsNodeJs slot="node-js" />
</SlotByFramework>

### Only denying specific bots

Some applications may only want to block a small subset of bots, while allowing
the majority continued access. This may be due to many reasons, such as
misconfigured or high-traffic bots.

This behavior is configured with a `deny` list from our [full list of
bots](https://arcjet.com/bot-list) and/or [bot
categories](/bot-protection/identifying-bots#bot-categories).

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <DenyingBotsNextJs slot="next-js" />
  <DenyingBotsNodeJs slot="node-js" />
</SlotByFramework>
