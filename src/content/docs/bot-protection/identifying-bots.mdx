For basic detection, Arcjet uses the `User-Agent` header to identify specific
bots. Advanced bot detection supplements this with additional fingerprinting
techniques such as IP address analysis.

Arcjet identifies and maintains a list of known bots, which are available in our
[bot list](https://arcjet.com/bot-list). If you are using TypeScript, these will
be shown as autocomplete values to `allow` or `deny` options while writing your
rules.

This list is used to allow developers to choose to allow or deny any or all of
these bots.

:::note
Requests without `User-Agent` headers can not be identified as any particular
bot and will be marked as an errored decision. Check `decision.isErrored()` and
decide if you want to allow or deny the request. Our recommendation is to block
requests without `User-Agent` headers because most legitimate clients always
send this header.

See [an example of how to do this](/bot-protection/concepts#user-agent-header).

## Known bots

Arcjet's list of known bots is comprised of two parts:

1. The [bot list](https://arcjet.com/bot-list) shipped with the SDK provides human
   readable identifiers for known bots.
2. The identifiers on the bot list are generated from [a collection of known
   bots](https://github.com/arcjet/well-known-bots) which includes details of
   their owner and any variations.

We welcome contributions to the
[arcjet/well-known-bots](https://github.com/arcjet/well-known-bots) repository,
whether you're adding new bots or updating detection patterns. Once merged, the
updates will be included in the next SDK release. Since bot detection is handled
within the Arcjet WebAssembly module bundled with the SDK, new patterns must be
compiled into the module as part of the release process.

### Known bots structure

Each entry in the known bots JSON represents a specific bot or crawler and includes the following fields:

- id: A unique identifier for the bot
- categories: An array of categories the bot belongs to (e.g. "search-engine", "advertising")
- pattern: A regular expression pattern used to identify the bot in user agent strings
- url: (optional) A URL with more information about the bot
- verification: A list of supported methods for verifying the bot's identity (if the bot is not verifiable it should be empty).
- instances: An array of example user agent strings for the bot that are validated against the `pattern`

#### Verification

Each verification entry contains the following fields:

- type: The method of verification (currently only `dns` is supported)
- masks: An array of mask patterns used for verification

#### Verification mask patterns

The mask patterns use the following special characters:

- *: Represents 0 or 1 of any character
- @: Acts as a wildcard, matching any number of characters

All other characters in the mask require an exact match.

## Bot categories

In addition to identifying individual bots, we also group bots into various
categories. You can leverage these categories for easier configuration of your
allow or deny lists.

Currently, we provide the following categories. You can see which bots are in
each category from the [bot list](https://arcjet.com/bot-list):

- `CATEGORY:ACADEMIC`: Scrape data for research purposes
- `CATEGORY:ADVERTISING`: Scrape data for advertising and marketing purposes
- `CATEGORY:AI`: Scrape data for AI and LLM purposes
- `CATEGORY:AMAZON`: Scrape data for Amazon products and services
- `CATEGORY:ARCHIVE`: Scrape data for archival purposes
- `CATEGORY:FEEDFETCHER`: Request data for RSS and other feeds
- `CATEGORY:GOOGLE`: Scrape data for Google products and services
- `CATEGORY:META`: Scrape data for Meta/Facebook products and services
- `CATEGORY:MICROSOFT`: Scrape data for Microsoft products and services
- `CATEGORY:MONITOR`: Interact for monitoring purposes
- `CATEGORY:OPTIMIZER`: Interact for optimization purposes
- `CATEGORY:PREVIEW`: Request data for image and URL previews
- `CATEGORY:PROGRAMMATIC`: Interact via programming language libraries
- `CATEGORY:SEARCH_ENGINE`: Index data for search engines
- `CATEGORY:SLACK`: Scrape data for Slack products and services
- `CATEGORY:SOCIAL`: Scrape data for social media products and services
- `CATEGORY:TOOL`: Interact via command line and GUI tools
- `CATEGORY:UNKNOWN`: Undetermined purposes
- `CATEGORY:VERCEL`: Scrape data for Vercel products and services
- `CATEGORY:YAHOO`: Scrape data for Yahoo products and services

We're continuously evaluating bots to decide if things should be reclassified.
If we determine enough bots exist for a new category, we'll consider adding new
ones. Please open an issue on our
[arcjet/well-known-bots](https://github.com/arcjet/well-known-bots) repository
if you need a specific category.

Only configured categories are checked for performance reasons. Each detected
bot must be compared to a category, so the worst case performance is
`count(detectedBot) * count(configuredCategories)`.
