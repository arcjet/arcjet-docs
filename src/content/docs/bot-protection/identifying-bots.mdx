Using an ever-evolving list of well known bots, Arcjet can detect and identify
almost 600 different bots. Using these, developers can choose to allow or deny
any or all of these bots.

:::note
Please be aware that requests without User-Agent headers can not be identified
as any particular bot and will be marked as an errored decision. Developers
should take caution to check `decision.isErrored()` and respond appropriately

## Well known bots

Arcjet identifies and maintains a list of nearly 600 well known bots, which
are available via our SDK in the
[well-known-bots.ts](https://github.com/arcjet/arcjet-js/blob/main/protocol/well-known-bots.ts)
file. If you are using TypeScript, these will be shown as autocomplete values
to `allow` or `deny` options while writing your rules.
