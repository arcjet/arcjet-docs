Arcjet allows you to configure a list of bots to allow or deny. To construct the
list, you can specify individual bots and/or use categories to allow or deny all
bots in a category.

If you are using TypeScript, these will be shown as autocomplete values to
`allow` or `deny` options while writing your rules.

## Individual bots

The [bot list](https://arcjet.com/bot-list) contains a list of known bots that
Arcjet can identify.

For example:

```ts
detectBot({
   mode: "LIVE", // will block requests. Use "DRY_RUN" to log only
   // Block all bots except specific Google and Bing crawlers, and curl
   allow: [
      "GOOGLE_CRAWLER",
      "GOOGLE_CRAWLER_NEWS",
      "BING_CRAWLER",
      "CURL",
   ],
}),
```

## Bot categories

We provide the following categories:

- `CATEGORY:ACADEMIC`: Scrape data for research purposes
- `CATEGORY:ADVERTISING`: Scrape data for advertising and marketing purposes
- `CATEGORY:AI`: Scrape data for AI and LLM purposes
- `CATEGORY:AMAZON`: Scrape data for Amazon products and services
- `CATEGORY:ARCHIVE`: Scrape data for archival purposes
- `CATEGORY:FEEDFETCHER`: Request data for RSS and other feeds
- `CATEGORY:GOOGLE`: Scrape data for Google products and services
- `CATEGORY:META`: Scrape data for Meta/Facebook products and services
- `CATEGORY:MICROSOFT`: Scrape data for Microsoft products and services
- `CATEGORY:MONITOR`: Interact for monitoring purposes
- `CATEGORY:OPTIMIZER`: Interact for optimization purposes
- `CATEGORY:PREVIEW`: Request data for image and URL previews
- `CATEGORY:PROGRAMMATIC`: Interact via programming language libraries
- `CATEGORY:SEARCH_ENGINE`: Index data for search engines
- `CATEGORY:SLACK`: Scrape data for Slack products and services
- `CATEGORY:SOCIAL`: Scrape data for social media products and services
- `CATEGORY:TOOL`: Interact via command line and GUI tools
- `CATEGORY:UNKNOWN`: Undetermined purposes
- `CATEGORY:VERCEL`: Scrape data for Vercel products and services
- `CATEGORY:YAHOO`: Scrape data for Yahoo products and services

The [bot
list](https://github.com/arcjet/arcjet-js/blob/24d2ee3139f277499ef3cb65f1f1eab998647819/protocol/well-known-bots.ts#L596)
contains a list of categories and which bots are in each category.

```ts
detectBot({
   mode: "LIVE", // will block requests. Use "DRY_RUN" to log only
   // Block all bots except search engines and curl
   allow: [
      "CATEGORY:SEARCH_ENGINE", // Google, Bing, etc
      "CURL", // You can allow specific bots in addition to categories
   ],
}),
```

Only configured categories are checked for performance reasons. Each detected
bot must be compared to a category, so the worst case performance is
`count(detectedBot) * count(configuredCategories)`.

We're continuously evaluating bots to decide if things should be reclassified.
If we determine enough bots exist for a new category, we'll consider adding new
ones. Please open an issue on our
[arcjet/well-known-bots](https://github.com/arcjet/well-known-bots) repository
if you need a specific category.

## Detection

For basic detection on the <Badge text="Free" variant="caution" /> plan, Arcjet
uses the `User-Agent` header to identify specific bots.

The Arcjet <Badge text="Pro" variant="note" /> plan or above provides additional
bot verification using IP analysis, which can help if you are under attack from
bots pretending to be good bots e.g. clients pretending to be Google (who you
usually want to allow).

:::note
Requests without `User-Agent` headers can not be identified as any particular
bot and will be marked as an errored decision. Check `decision.isErrored()` and
decide if you want to allow or deny the request. Our recommendation is to block
requests without `User-Agent` headers because most legitimate clients always
send this header.

See [an example of how to do this](/bot-protection/concepts#user-agent-header).

### Known bots structure

The identifiers on the bot list are generated from [a collection of known
bots](https://github.com/arcjet/well-known-bots) which includes details of their
owner and any variations.

We welcome contributions to the
[arcjet/well-known-bots](https://github.com/arcjet/well-known-bots) repository,
whether you're adding new bots or updating detection patterns. Once merged, the
updates will be included in the next SDK release. Since bot detection is handled
within the Arcjet WebAssembly module bundled with the SDK, new patterns must be
compiled into the module as part of the release process.

Each entry in the known bots JSON represents a specific bot or crawler and
includes the following fields:

- `id`: A unique identifier for the bot
- `categories`: An array of categories the bot belongs to (e.g. "search-engine",
  "advertising")
- `pattern`: A regular expression pattern used to identify the bot in user agent
  strings
- `url`: (optional) A URL with more information about the bot
- `verification`: A list of supported methods for verifying the bot's identity
  (if the bot is not verifiable it should be empty).
- `instances`: An array of example user agent strings for the bot that are
  validated against the `pattern`

#### Verification

Each verification entry contains the following fields:

- `type`: The method of verification (currently only `dns` is supported)
- `masks`: An array of mask patterns used for verification

#### Verification mask patterns

The mask patterns use the following special characters:

- `\*`: Represents 0 or 1 of any character
- `@`: Acts as a wildcard, matching any number of characters

All other characters in the mask require an exact match.
