For basic detection, Arcjet uses the `User-Agent` header to identify specific
bots. Advanced bot detection supplements this with additional fingerprinting
techniques such as IP address analysis.

Arcjet identifies and maintains a list of known bots, which are available in our
[bot list](https://arcjet.com/bot-list). If you are using TypeScript, these will
be shown as autocomplete values to `allow` or `deny` options while writing your
rules.

This list is used to allow developers to choose to allow or deny any or all of
these bots.

:::note
Please be aware that requests without `User-Agent` headers can not be identified
as any particular bot and will be marked as an errored decision. Developers
should take caution to check `decision.isErrored()` and decide if you want to
allow or deny the request. See the Error Handling section in the SDK reference
for an example. Our recommendation is to block requests without `User-Agent`
headers because most clients always send this header.
