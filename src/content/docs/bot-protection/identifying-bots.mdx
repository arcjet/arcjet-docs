For basic detection, Arcjet uses the `User-Agent` header to identify specific
bots. Advanced bot detection supplements this with additional fingerprinting
techniques such as IP address analysis.

Arcjet identifies and maintains a list of known bots, which are available in our
[bot list](https://arcjet.com/bot-list). If you are using TypeScript, these will
be shown as autocomplete values to `allow` or `deny` options while writing your
rules.

This list is used to allow developers to choose to allow or deny any or all of
these bots.

:::note
Please be aware that requests without `User-Agent` headers can not be identified
as any particular bot and will be marked as an errored decision. Developers
should take caution to check `decision.isErrored()` and decide if you want to
allow or deny the request. See the Error Handling section in the SDK reference
for an example. Our recommendation is to block requests without `User-Agent`
headers because most clients always send this header.

## Known bots

Arcjet's list of known bots is comprised of two parts:

1. The [bot list](https://arcjet.com/bot-list) shipped with the SDK provides human
   readable identifiers for known bots.
2. The identifiers on the bot list are generated from [a collection of known
   bots](https://github.com/arcjet/well-known-bots) which includes details of
   their owner and any variations.

We welcome contributions to the
[arcjet/well-known-bots](https://github.com/arcjet/well-known-bots) repository,
whether you're adding new bots or updating detection patterns. Once merged, the
updates will be included in the next SDK release. Since bot detection is handled
within the Arcjet WebAssembly module bundled with the SDK, new patterns must be
compiled into the module as part of the release process.
