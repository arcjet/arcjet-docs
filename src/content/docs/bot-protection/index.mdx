Arcjet bot protection lets you detect bots, block bad bots, verify
legitimate bots, and reduce unwanted automated requests before they reach
your application.

<WhatIsArcjet />

Bots are not all the same. Some are useful (for example, search engine crawlers)
and identify themselves consistently, which makes them easy to detect and allow.
However, these are rarely the bots you want to block.

Malicious or unwanted bots often pretend to be real users and use a variety of
techniques to evade bot detection. In an ideal world all bots would respect
`robots.txt`, but in practice many ignore it entirely. You need a reliable way
to detect bots and decide what to do with them inside your application.

Arcjet bot protection is different from similar features on other platforms
because you configure bot detection and blocking inside your application code.
This gives you full, dynamic control over what to allow or deny, where, and
when. You can apply different bot protection strategies per route, or base
decisions on what you know about a request (for example, a logged-in user's
subscription level).

## Key benefits of Arcjet bot protection

- Detect and classify hundreds of known bots and crawlers.
- Block bad bots and unwanted automated traffic.
- Allow verified “good” bots (such as search engine crawlers) safely.
- Configure bot rules directly in your application code.
- Combine bot protection with rate limiting and filters for full traffic
  control.

## When to use bot protection

Use Arcjet bot protection whenever you need to control traffic from
automated clients and bots, for example:

- Signup and login forms targeted by credential stuffing or spam.
- APIs and endpoints scraped by bots.
- Pricing pages, search, or content pages that attract heavy scraping.

Arcjet reduces unwanted bot traffic and gives you more control over what
reaches your application, but it's important to understand that no bot
detection system can be 100% accurate.

Combine Arcjet bot protection with other Arcjet features to improve your
overall traffic management strategy, such as
[rate limiting][arcjet-rate-limiting] and [filters][arcjet-filters].

## In-app bot detection vs network/CDN bot protection

Traditional bot protection runs at the network or CDN layer and often
provides a fixed set of rules. Arcjet bot protection runs inside your
application, where you have access to rich context such as user identity,
subscription level, and business logic. This lets you build more accurate,
application-aware bot rules and avoid blocking legitimate users.

## How Arcjet bot detection works

Arcjet detects more than 600 different bots (such as `GOOGLE_CRAWLER`) and
classifies them into 25 categories (such as `CATEGORY:AI`). You can specify
individual bots or entire categories to allow or deny.

The identifiers of specific bots and categories, and their corresponding
detection and verification patterns, are open source and maintained in
[`arcjet/well-known-bots`][github-arcjet-well-known-bots], which ships with the
Arcjet SDK. Names and categories are autocompleted in your editor if you use
TypeScript.

For basic bot detection, regular expressions are applied to the
`user-agent` header and authenticity is verified using IP data and reverse
DNS lookups.

Advanced bot detection adds IP reputation,
[verification][arcjet-bot-protection-reference-verification],
machine learning, and additional signals to identify bots more accurately
and distinguish real users from automated traffic.

Clients are tracked using configurable
[fingerprints][arcjet-fingerprints] (IP address by default) to identify
unique clients. Fingerprints let you track anonymous users and attach rules
and detections to known users via session tokens or other identifiers.

## Availability

Basic detection (using `user-agent` headers and IP type analysis) is available
on all plans.

Advanced detection (using IP reputation,
[verification][arcjet-bot-protection-reference-verification], machine learning,
and additional signals) is available on paid plans.
