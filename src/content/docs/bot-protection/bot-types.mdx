By default, Arcjet will not block any clients. You can choose which types you
wish to block in the `bots.block` configuration option:

- `NOT_ANALYZED` - We could not analyze the request, perhaps because of
  insufficient information or because the bot analysis can't be executed in this
  environment. We do not recommend blocking these requests. Represented by a
  score of 0.
- `AUTOMATED` - We are sure the request was made by an automated bot. We
  recommend blocking these requests for paths which are for humans only e.g.
  login or signup pages, but not blocking for API paths. Represented by a score
  of 1.
- `LIKELY_AUTOMATED` - We have some evidence that the request was made by an
  automated bot. The degree of certainty is represented by a score range of
  2-29 (higher = greater certainty).
- `LIKELY_NOT_A_BOT` - We don't think this request was made by an automated bot.
  The degree of certainty is represented by a score range of 30-99 (higher =
  greater certainty).
- `VERIFIED_BOT` - We are sure the request was made by an automated bot and it
  is on our list of verified good bots. This is a list maintained by the Arcjet
  team and includes bots such as monitoring agents and friendly search engine
  crawlers. In most cases you can allow these requests on public pages, but you
  may wish to block them for internal or private paths. Represented by a score
  of 100.

## Bot detection result

Arcjet returns more information about what type of client we think made the
request:

- `botType` (`ArcjetBotType`) and `botScore` (`int`) indicate the type of client
  we think it is and the degree of certainty as represented by the integer
  score.
- `ipHosting` (`bool`): whether the IP address of the client is owned by a
  hosting provider. Requests originating from a hosting provider IP
  significantly increase the likelihood that this is an automated client.
- `ipVpn` (`bool`): whether the IP address of the client is owned by a VPN
  provider. Many people use VPNs for privacy or work purposes, so by itself this
  is not an indicator of the client being automated. However, it does increase
  the risk score of the client and depending on your use case it may be a
  characteristic you wish to restrict.
- `ipProxy` (`bool`): whether the IP address of the client is owned by a proxy
  provider. Similar to `isVpn`, but proxies are more likely to involve automated
  traffic.
- `ipTor` (`bool`): whether the IP address of the client is known to be part of
  the Tor network. As with `ipVpn`, there are legitimate uses for hiding your
  identity through Tor, however it is also often a way to hide the origin of
  malicious traffic.
- `ipRelay` (`bool`): whether the IP address of the client is owned by a relay
  service. The most common example is Apple iCloud Relay, which indicates the
  client is less likely to be automated because Apple requires a paid
  subscription linked to an Apple account in good standing.
- `userAgentMatch` (`bool`): whether the client user agent matched one of our
  known bot user agents. Good bots identify themselves by user agent, but bad
  bots may masquerade as good bots. This is only useful when combined with our
  list of verified IPs to return the bot type of `VERIFIED_BOT`.

These are all available in the decision response. See [the Next.js
documentation](/bot-protection/reference/nextjs#bot-type) for an example of
accessing this.
