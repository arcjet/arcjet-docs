With Arcjet Bot protection you can manage traffic by automated clients and bots.

Bots can be good or bad.
Good bots identify themselves in a consistent manner so it is straightforward
to identify them,
but those are often not the bots you wish to block!
Bad bots pretend to be real clients and use various mechanisms to evade bot
detection.
In an ideal world,
all bots would respect `robots.txt` files,
but unfortunately this is not always the case.

Other platforms also provide bot protection.
With Arcjet you configure bot protection _inside_ your application code.
This gives you full control over what to allow, where and when, dynamically.
You can use different strategies for different routes or based on user
subscription level.

## When to use

You can use Bot protection to manage traffic by automated clients and bots.
Arcjet helps reduce bot traffic and gives you more control over what reaches
your application,
but it’s important to understand that it’s not possible to achieve 100%
accuracy.

You can combine this with [Arcjet Rate limiting][arcjet-rate-limiting] to block
clients that are causing problems while minimizing the impact on real users.

You can use [Arcjet Filters][arcjet-filters] to block other clients.

## How it works

Arcjet detects more than 600 different bots (such as `GOOGLE_CRAWLER`) and classifies
them in 25 different categories (such as `CATEGORY:AI`).
You can specify individual bots or categories to allow or deny.

The identifiers of specific bots and categories,
and their corresponding detection and verification patterns,
are open source and maintained in
[`arcjet/well-known-bots`][github-arcjet-well-known-bots].
This data is shipped locally within the WebAssembly bundled with SDKs.
Names and categories are autocompleted in your editor if you use TypeScript.

Bots are detected using regular expressions against the `user-agent` header
and their authenticity verified by checking IP data and performing reverse DNS
lookups.

Clients are tracked by [fingerprints][arcjet-fingerprints] that include
IP addresses by default.
This means that clients using the same IP address as a bot can be blocked.
To ensure that rules are applied correctly it is important to carefully
select characteristics,
such as a specific HTTP header or an authentication token,
to match your concept of “user”.

## Availability

Basic detection through `user-agent` headers and IP type analysis is available on all plans.
Advanced detection uses additional IP reputation,
[verification][arcjet-bot-protection-reference-verification],
machine learning,
and other signals, are used on paid plans.
