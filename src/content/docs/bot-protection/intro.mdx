Arcjet bot detection allows you to block and manage bot traffic, verify
legitimate bots, and reduce unwanted automated requests.

<WhatIsArcjet />

Bots can be good or bad.
Good bots identify themselves in a consistent manner so it is straightforward
to identify them,
but those are often not the bots you wish to block!
Bad bots pretend to be real clients and use various mechanisms to evade bot
detection.
In an ideal world,
all bots would respect `robots.txt` files,
but unfortunately this is not always the case.

Arcjet Bot protection is different from similar features on other platforms
because with Arcjet you configure bot protection _inside_ your application code.
This gives you full control over what to allow, where and when, dynamically. You
can use different strategies for different routes or based on what you know
about a request e.g. a logged in user's subscription level.

## When to use

You can use bot protection to manage traffic by automated clients and bots.
Arcjet helps reduce bot traffic and gives you more control over what reaches
your application,
but it’s important to understand that it’s not possible to achieve 100%
accuracy.

Arcjet bot protection can be combined with other Arcjet features to improve your
overall traffic management strategy, such as [rate
limiting][arcjet-rate-limiting] and [filters][arcjet-filters].

## How it works

Arcjet detects more than 600 different bots (such as `GOOGLE_CRAWLER`) and classifies
them in 25 different categories (such as `CATEGORY:AI`).
You can specify individual bots or categories to allow or deny.

The identifiers of specific bots and categories,
and their corresponding detection and verification patterns,
are open source and maintained in
[`arcjet/well-known-bots`][github-arcjet-well-known-bots].
This data is shipped locally within the WebAssembly bundled with SDKs.
Names and categories are autocompleted in your editor if you use TypeScript.

For basic bot detection, regular expressions are used against the `user-agent`
header and their authenticity verified by checking IP data and performing
reverse DNS lookups. Advanced bot detection uses additional IP reputation,
machine learning, and other signals to identify bots more accurately.

Clients are tracked by configurable [fingerprints][arcjet-fingerprints] (IP
address by default) to identify unique clients. This can be used to track
anonymous users as well as attaching rules and detections to known users by
their session tokens or other identifiers.

## Availability

Basic detection through `user-agent` headers and IP type analysis is available on all plans.
Advanced detection uses additional IP reputation,
[verification][arcjet-bot-protection-reference-verification],
machine learning,
and other signals, are used on paid plans.
