Arcjet rate limiting lets you control how many requests a client can make to
your application or API over a given period of time.

<WhatIsArcjet />

Application-level rate limiting is useful to protect your server from overload,
prevent abuse of APIs, and make brute-force login attacks expensive and
impractical.

Other platforms also provide rate limiting, usually at the CDN or network layer.
Arcjet rate limiting is different because you configure limits inside your
application code. This gives you full, dynamic control over what to allow or
block, where, and when. You can use different strategies per route, per
endpoint, or based on user subscription level.

You do not need any extra infrastructure (such as Redis) to keep track of state.
Arcjet handles rate limit tracking for you.

## When to use Arcjet rate limiting

Use Arcjet rate limiting to protect your application and APIs from abuse and
excessive traffic. For example:

- **Protect login and authentication flows**
  Limit how often a user can attempt to log in (for example, 5 attempts in 5
  minutes) to slow down attackers trying many username/password combinations.

- **Throttle API clients**
  Limit how many requests a client can make to an API (for example, 100 requests
  per minute) to prevent a single client from overloading your API or impacting
  other users.

- **Enforce quotas and usage tiers**
  Implement per-plan quotas (for example, free tier clients can make 1,000
  requests per day, paid tiers get higher limits) and enforce them directly in
  your application code.

Rate limiting is complementary to [Arcjet Shield WAF][arcjet-shield]. Shield
analyzes what kind of requests are made over time and blocks clients that show
repeated suspicious behavior, while rate limiting focuses on controlling request
volume and frequency.

## How Arcjet rate limiting works

Arcjet rate limiting keeps track of how many requests a client makes and
compares this to the limits you configure. When a client exceeds a configured
limit, Arcjet marks the request as over limit so your application can block,
delay, or otherwise handle it. The client is allowed again once the rate limit
condition is reset.

Tracking happens in the Arcjet Cloud API and does not require any additional
infrastructure such as Redis. State is maintained for you, even across multiple
instances of your application.

### Rate limit algorithms

Arcjet supports several rate limiting algorithms so you can choose the behavior
that best fits your use case:

- [**Fixed window**](/rate-limiting/algorithms#fixed-window) Counts requests in
  discrete time windows (for example, 100 requests per minute, reset every
  minute).

- [**Sliding window**](/rate-limiting/algorithms#sliding-window) Uses a moving
  time window to smooth out bursts and avoid sharp reset boundaries.

- [**Token bucket**](/rate-limiting/algorithms#token-bucket) Allows short bursts
  while enforcing an average rate over time, by consuming and replenishing
  tokens.

You can choose different algorithms for different endpoints, clients, or
subscription tiers.

### Fingerprints and identifying clients

Clients are tracked by configurable [fingerprints][arcjet-fingerprints] that
include IP addresses by default. This means clients using the same IP address
are counted and limited together.

To ensure rate limits are applied correctly, choose fingerprint characteristics
that align with your concept of a “user”. For example:

- IP address only (per-IP limits),
- IP + API key (per-client limits),
- User ID or authentication token (per-account limits).

Matching fingerprints to the right identifiers is critical to applying rate
limits fairly and avoiding unintended blocking.

## Availability

Rate limiting is available on all Arcjet plans:
