With Arcjet Rate limiting you can limit the number of requests a client can
make over a period of time.

Rate limiting is useful for example to prevent a client from overloading your server,
or to make it costly to try to login with different usernames and passwords.

Other platforms also provide rate limiting.
With Arcjet you configure rate limiting _inside_ your application code.
This gives you full control over what to allow, where and when, dynamically.
You can use different strategies for different routes or based on user
subscription level.
You do not need any infrastructure (such as Redis) to keep track of state.

## When to use

You can use Rate limiting to protect your application from abuse.
For example:

- Prevent brute force attacks on your login page. E.g. a user can only attempt
  to login 5 times in a 5 minute period. This prevents an attacker from trying
  multiple username or password combinations.
- Prevent API clients from making too many requests. E.g. a client can only make
  100 requests per minute. This prevents a client from overloading your API.
- Implement quotas e.g. a free tier client can only make 1000 requests per day.

Rate limiting is similar to [Arcjet Shield WAF][arcjet-shield].
That analyzes what kind of requests are made over time and blocks clients that
show repeated suspicious behavior.

## How it works

Arcjet rate limiting keeps track of the number of requests made by a client.
Arcjet supports several rate limit algorithms.
Clients are blocked from making requests when they exceed a particular limit,
until a certain condition allows them again.

Tracking happens in the Arcjet Cloud API and does not require any additional
infrastructure such as Redis.

The rate limit algorithms are:

- [fixed window](/rate-limiting/algorithms#fixed-window)
- [sliding window](/rate-limiting/algorithms#sliding-window)
- [token bucket](/rate-limiting/algorithms#token-bucket)

Clients are tracked by [fingerprints][arcjet-fingerprints] that include
IP addresses by default.
This means that clients using the same IP address are counted and blocked.
To ensure that rate limits are applied correctly it is important to carefully
select characteristics,
such as a specific HTTP header or an authentication token,
to match your concept of “user”.

## Availability

You can use a single rate limit rule on the free plan.
Additional rate limit rules are possible on paid plans.
With multi-config you can manage varying traffic patterns based on different
client characteristics,
such as one per IP and one per API key.
