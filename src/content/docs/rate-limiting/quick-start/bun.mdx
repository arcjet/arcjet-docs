Arcjet rate limiting allows you to define rules which limit the number of
requests a client can make over a period of time.

## SDK installation

Follow these steps to get started:

### 1. Install Arcjet

In your project root, run the following command to install the SDK:

```bash
bun add @arcjet/bun
```

### 2. Set your key

[Create a free Arcjet account](https://app.arcjet.com) then follow the
instructions to add a site and get a key. Add it to a `.env.local` file in your
Bun project root.

Arcjet only accept non-local IP addresses with a fallback to 127.0.0.1 in development mode, and since Bun
doesn't set `NODE_ENV` for you like Node.js does, you also need to set
`ARCJET_ENV` in your environment file.

```ini title=".env.local"
# Run Arcjet in development mode because Bun.sh doesn't explicitly
# set an environment variable like Node.js does
ARCJET_ENV=development
ARCJET_KEY=ajkey_yourkey
```

### 3. Add a rate limit to a route

The rate limit example below applies a token bucket rate limit rule to a route
where we identify the user based on their ID e.g. if they are logged in. The
bucket is configured with a maximum capacity of 10 tokens and refills by 5
tokens every 10 seconds. Each request consumes 5 tokens.

    <Code code={Step3TS} lang="ts" title="index.ts" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="JS">
    <Code code={Step3JS} lang="ts" title="index.js" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 4. Start server

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="TS">
  ```sh 
  bun run --hot index.ts
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="JS">
  ```sh 
  bun run --hot index.js
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Then make some requests to hit the rate limit:

```sh
curl http://localhost:3000
```

## What next?

Arcjet can be used with specific rules on individual routes or as general
protection on your entire application. You can customize bot protection, rate
limiting for your API and minimize fraudulent registrations with the signup form
protection.
