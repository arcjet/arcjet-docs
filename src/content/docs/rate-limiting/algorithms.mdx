Arcjet rate limiting allows you to define rules which limit the number of
requests a client can make over a period of time. It supports 3 different rate
limit algorithms: [fixed window](#fixed-window), [sliding
window](#sliding-window) and [token bucket](#token-bucket).

<WhatIsArcjet />

## Fixed window

This is the simplest algorithm. It tracks the number of requests made by a
client over a fixed time window e.g. 60 seconds. If the client exceeds the
limit, they are blocked until the window expires.

### When to use fixed window

This algorithm is useful when you want to apply a simple fixed limit in a fixed
time window. For example, a simple limit on the total number of requests a
client can make.

### Downsides of fixed window

- A burst of requests at the start of the window will exhaust the limit for
  newer requests.
- A client can make a burst of requests at the end of the window and continue to
  burst as the window resets. This can cause request stampedes where clients
  suddenly become unblocked at the start of a new window.

### Fixed window example

In this example, we define a fixed window rate limit rule which allows a maximum
of 100 requests in a 60 second window. The rule is applied to all requests to
`/api/hello` and is tracked by the client's IP address.

<Code code={FixedWindow} lang="ts" />

If the time is `12:00:00` and a client makes a burst of 50 requests, then they
make another 50 requests over the following 30 seconds, they will be blocked
from making any further requests until `12:01:00`. At `12:01:00` the window
resets and they could make another 100 requests immediately.

## Sliding window

This algorithm tracks the number of requests made by a client over a sliding
window so that the window moves with time.

### When to use sliding window

This algorithm is useful to avoid the stampede problem of the fixed window. It
provides smoother rate limiting over time and can prevent a client from making a
burst of requests at the start of a window and then being blocked for the rest
of the window.

### Downsides of sliding window

- The limit is not as strict as fixed window because the time window is
  continuously moving.
- It can be more difficult to reason about the rate limit because the window is
  always moving.

### Sliding window example

In this example, we define a sliding window rate limit which allows a maximum of
100 requests in a 60 second window. The rule is applied to all requests to
`/api/hello` and is tracked by the client's IP address.

<Code code={SlidingWindow} lang="ts" />

If the client made 50 requests in the time period `12:00:00` to `12:01:00` and
then made another 50 requests in the current time period as of `12:01:30` then
we would calculate the remaining rate limit as follows:

```ts
// 50 requests in the previous interval
// 60 seconds per interval
// 30 seconds elapsed in the current interval
// 50 requests made in the current interval
rate = 50 * ((60 - 30) / 60) + 50 = 75
limit = 100
remaining = limit - rate = 25
```

In this case, the client has 25 requests remaining in the current interval.

## Token bucket

This algorithm is based on a bucket filled with a specific number of tokens.
Each request withdraws a token from the bucket and the bucket is refilled at a
fixed rate. Once the bucket is empty, the client is blocked until the bucket
refills.

### When to use token bucket

This algorithm is useful when you want to allow clients to make a burst of
requests and then still be able to make requests at a slower rate.

### Downsides of token bucket

- The bucket can be exhausted by a burst of requests and then (depending on your
  configured refill rate) take a long time to refill. This can cause a client to
  be blocked for a long time.

### Token bucket example

In this example, we define a token bucket rate limit with a bucket capacity of
100 tokens and a refill rate of 10 tokens per minute. The rule is applied to all
requests to `/api/hello` and is tracked by the client's IP address.

<Code code={TokenBucket} lang="ts" />

The amount of tokens to deduct from the bucket is specified when calling the
Arcjet `protect` function. You can request any number of tokens up to the
capacity of the bucket.

```ts
// Deduct 1 token from the bucket
const decision = await aj.protect(req, { requested: 1 });
```

For example, if it is `12:00:00` and a client makes 100 requests each with 1
token deducted, further requests will be blocked until `12:01:00` when the
bucket refills by 10 tokens. The client could then make 10 requests over the
following 60 seconds. If they make no requests, the bucket will refill to 20
tokens at `12:02:00`. If they make no requests between `12:01:00` and `12:10:00`
then the bucket will refill to 100 tokens at `12:10:00`. No further tokens will
be added after it reaches 100 tokens.
