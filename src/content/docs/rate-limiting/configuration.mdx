Each Arcjet rate limit rule has its own configuration depending on the algorithm
used.

## Characteristics

**Type:** `Array<string>` (optional)

**Algorithms:** `fixedWindow`, `slidingWindow`, `tokenBucket`.

Defines how Arcjet will track the rate limit.

If this is not set then the characteristics set on the root Arcjet object will be used.

:::note
For most use cases it is better to use the [global characteristics set on the root Arcjet object.](/architecture#built-in-characteristics)
This is because we cache rate limit decisions using a fingerprint that is generated with these characteristics.
If the characteristics used to compute the fingerprint are different from those used to apply the rate limit
it can result in cached rate limit decisions being applied to the wrong set of users.
:::

### Built-in characteristics

The built-in options are managed by the SDK and are always available.
If more than one option is provided, they will be combined.

:::caution
If you specify different characteristics and do not include `ip.src`, you may
inadvertently rate limit everyone. Be sure to include a characteristic which can
narrowly identify each client. For example, use a header value to limit based on
a session token or authentication header.

| Option                                        |     Description      |
| :-------------------------------------------- | :------------------: |
| `ip.src`                                      |  Client IP address   |
| `http.host`                                   |     Request host     |
| `http.request.headers["<header_name>"]`       | Request header value |
| `http.request.cookie["<cookie_name>"]`        | Request cookie value |
| `http.request.uri.args["<query_param_name>"]` | Request query value  |
| `http.request.uri.path`                       |     Request path     |

### Custom characteristics

You can use custom characteristics to track rate limits. For example, you can
set up a limit for a logged in user by setting their user ID as the identifier.
This will apply the limit to all requests made by that user regardless of their
device and IP address.

Custom characteristics are defined with a string key when configuring the rate
limit rule. The value is then passed as a `string`, `number` or `boolean` when
calling the `protect` method. You can use any string value for the key.

:::caution
Avoid passing personal information such as an email address as a custom
characteristic. The value is hashed on Arcjet's servers, but it's still a best
practice to avoid sending us sensitive information.
:::

#### User ID

In this example we create a custom characteristic called `userId`, but you can call it anything you like:

<Code code={FixedWindowCustomCharacteristicRule} lang="ts" />

Then when calling the `protect` method, you would pass a value for the key:

```ts
// Pass userId as a string to identify the user. This can be any string,
// number or boolean value. Multiple values will be combined.
const decision = await aj.protect(req, { userId: "user123" });
```

#### IP address + User ID

If you want to be more flexible and use the user IP address for anonymous users
and a user ID for logged in users, you can create a custom fingerprint
characteristic that is defined separately:

<Code code={FixedWindowCustomCharacteristicFingerprintRule} lang="ts" />

Then when calling the `protect` method, you would pass a value for the key:

```ts
if (userIsLoggedIn) {
  // Set fingerprint to the user ID from the session or database
  const fingerprint = "userId";
  const decision = await aj.protect(req, { fingerprint });
} else {
  // In Next.js, you can use `req.ip` to get the user's IP address. Other
  // frameworks may have different methods.
  const fingerprint = req.ip;
  const decision = await aj.protect(req, { fingerprint });
}
```

## Max

**Type:** `int` (required)

**Algorithms:** `fixedWindow`, `slidingWindow`.

The maximum number of requests allowed in the time window. This is an integer
value ranging from `0` to `4,294,967,295`.

## Window

**Type:** `string | int` (required)

**Algorithms:** `fixedWindow`.

The time window the rate limit applies to. Can be an `int` specifying the window
size in seconds ranging from `0` to `4,294,967,295`. Alternatively, you can use
a `string` with a sequence of numbers, each with a unit suffix e.g. `1s` for 1
second, `1h45m` for 1 hour and 45 minutes, `1d` for 1 day.

Valid string time units are:

- `s` for seconds.
- `m` for minutes.
- `h` for hours.
- `d` for days.

## Interval

**Type:** `string | int` (required)

**Algorithms:** `slidingWindow`, `tokenBucket`.

For `slidingWindow`, the time interval for the rate limit. For example, if you set
the interval to `60` the sliding window will be 60 seconds.

For `tokenBucket`, the time interval for the refill rate (see below). For
example, if you set the interval to `60` and the refill rate to `10`, the bucket
will refill 10 tokens every 60 seconds.

In both cases, the value can be an `int` in seconds ranging from `0` to
`4,294,967,295`. Alternatively, you can use a `string` with a sequence of
numbers, each with a unit suffix e.g. `1s` for 1 second, `1h45m` for 1 hour and
45 minutes, `1d` for 1 day.

Valid string time units are:

- `s` for seconds.
- `m` for minutes.
- `h` for hours.
- `d` for days.

## Refill rate

**Type:** `int` (required)

**Algorithms:** `tokenBucket`.

The number of tokens to add to the bucket at each interval (see above). This is
an integer value ranging from `0` to `4,294,967,295`. For example, if you set
the interval to `60` and the refill rate to `10`, the bucket will refill 10
tokens every 60 seconds.

## Capacity

**Type:** `int` (required)

**Algorithms:** `tokenBucket`.

The maximum number of tokens the bucket can hold. The bucket will refill until
it hits the capacity. This is an integer value ranging from `0` to
`4,294,967,295`.
