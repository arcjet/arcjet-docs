Each Arcjet rate limit rule has its own configuration depending on the algorithm
used.

## Max

**Type:** `int` (required)

**Algorithms:** `fixedWindow`, `slidingWindow`.

The maximum number of requests allowed in the time window. This is an integer
value ranging from `0` to `4,294,967,295`.

## Window

**Type:** `string | int` (required)

**Algorithms:** `fixedWindow`.

The time window the rate limit applies to. Can be an `int` specifying the window
size in seconds ranging from `0` to `4,294,967,295`. Alternatively, you can use
a `string` with a sequence of numbers, each with a unit suffix e.g. `1s` for 1
second, `1h45m` for 1 hour and 45 minutes, `1d` for 1 day.

Valid string time units are:

- `s` for seconds.
- `m` for minutes.
- `h` for hours.
- `d` for days.

## Interval

**Type:** `string | int` (required)

**Algorithms:** `slidingWindow`, `tokenBucket`.

For `slidingWindow`, the time interval for the rate limit. For example, if you set
the interval to `60` the sliding window will be 60 seconds.

For `tokenBucket`, the time interval for the refill rate (see below). For
example, if you set the interval to `60` and the refill rate to `10`, the bucket
will refill 10 tokens every 60 seconds.

In both cases, the value can be an `int` in seconds ranging from `0` to
`4,294,967,295`. Alternatively, you can use a `string` with a sequence of
numbers, each with a unit suffix e.g. `1s` for 1 second, `1h45m` for 1 hour and
45 minutes, `1d` for 1 day.

Valid string time units are:

- `s` for seconds.
- `m` for minutes.
- `h` for hours.
- `d` for days.

## Refill rate

**Type:** `int` (required)

**Algorithms:** `tokenBucket`.

The number of tokens to add to the bucket at each interval (see above). This is
an integer value ranging from `0` to `4,294,967,295`. For example, if you set
the interval to `60` and the refill rate to `10`, the bucket will refill 10
tokens every 60 seconds.

## Capacity

**Type:** `int` (required)

**Algorithms:** `tokenBucket`.

The maximum number of tokens the bucket can hold. The bucket will refill until
it hits the capacity. This is an integer value ranging from `0` to
`4,294,967,295`.
