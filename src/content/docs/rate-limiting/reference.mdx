Arcjet rate limiting allows you to define rules which limit the number of
requests a client can make over a period of time.

## Plan availability

Arcjet rate limiting is available on all [pricing
plans](https://arcjet.com/pricing).

| Plan                                                                             | Rate limiting |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| <Badge text="Free" variant="caution" />                                          | Single-config |
| <Badge text="Starter" variant="note" /> <Badge text="Business" variant="tip" / > | Multi-config  |
| <Badge text="Enterprise" variant="danger" />                                     | Custom        |

### What is single-config vs multi-config?

Single-config allows you to define a single rate limit configuration for all
clients e.g. per IP address, while multi-config enables different configurations
based on client characteristics e.g. a rate limit per IP and a separate rate
limit per API key. This flexibility helps in managing varying traffic patterns
and requirements.

  client:load
/>

## Configuration

Each rate limit is configured on an exact path with a set of client
characteristics and algorithm specific options.

### Fixed window rate limit options

Tracks the number of requests made by a client over a fixed time window. Options
are explained in the [Configuration](/rate-limiting/configuration)
documentation. See the [fixed window algorithm
description](/rate-limiting/algorithms#fixed-window) for more details about how
the algorithm works.

```ts
// Options for fixed window rate limit
// See https://docs.arcjet.com/rate-limiting/configuration
type FixedWindowRateLimitOptions = {
  // "LIVE" will block requests. "DRY_RUN" will log only
  mode?: "LIVE" | "DRY_RUN";
  // How the client is identified. See https://docs.arcjet.com/fingerprints
  characteristics?: string[];
  // Time window the rate limit applies to
  window: string;
  // Maximum number of requests allowed in the time window
  max: number;
};
```

#### Fixed window example

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <FixedWindowBun slot="bun" />
  <FixedWindowNestJs slot="nest-js" />
  <FixedWindowNextJs slot="next-js" />
  <FixedWindowNodeJs slot="node-js" />
  <FixedWindowRemix slot="remix" />
  <FixedWindowSvelteKit slot="sveltekit" />
</SlotByFramework>

### Sliding window rate limit options

Tracks the number of requests made by a client over a sliding window so that the
window moves with time. Options are explained in the
[Configuration](/rate-limiting/configuration) documentation. See the [sliding
window algorithm description](/rate-limiting/algorithms#sliding-window) for more
details about how the algorithm works.

```ts
// Options for sliding window rate limit
// See https://docs.arcjet.com/rate-limiting/configuration
type SlidingWindowRateLimitOptions = {
  // "LIVE" will block requests. "DRY_RUN" will log only
  mode?: "LIVE" | "DRY_RUN";
  // How the client is identified. See https://docs.arcjet.com/fingerprints
  characteristics?: string[];
  // The time interval in seconds for the rate limit
  interval: number;
  // Maximum number of requests allowed over the time interval
  max: number;
};
```

#### Sliding window example

  <SlidingWindowBun slot="bun" />
  <SlidingWindowNestJs slot="nest-js" />
  <SlidingWindowNextJs slot="next-js" />
  <SlidingWindowNodeJs slot="node-js" />
  <SlidingWindowRemix slot="remix" />
  <SlidingWindowSvelteKit slot="sveltekit" />
</SlotByFramework>

### Token bucket rate limit options

Based on a bucket filled with a specific number of tokens. Each request
withdraws a token from the bucket and the bucket is refilled at a fixed rate.
Once the bucket is empty, the client is blocked until the bucket refills.
Options are explained in the [Configuration](/rate-limiting/configuration)
documentation. See the [token bucket algorithm
description](/rate-limiting/algorithms#token-bucket) for more details about how
the algorithm works.

```ts
// Options for token bucket rate limit
// See https://docs.arcjet.com/rate-limiting/configuration
type TokenBucketRateLimitOptions = {
  // "LIVE" will block requests. "DRY_RUN" will log only
  mode?: "LIVE" | "DRY_RUN";
  // How the client is identified. See https://docs.arcjet.com/fingerprints
  characteristics?: string[];
  // Number of tokens to add to the bucket at each interval
  refillRate: number;
  // The interval in seconds to add tokens to the bucket
  interval: number;
  // The maximum number of tokens the bucket can hold
  capacity: number;
};
```

#### Token bucket example

See the [token bucket request example](#token-bucket-request) for how to specify
the number of tokens to request.

  <TokenBucketBun slot="bun" />
  <TokenBucketNestJs slot="nest-js" />
  <TokenBucketNextJs slot="next-js" />
  <TokenBucketNodeJs slot="node-js" />
  <TokenBucketRemix slot="remix" />
  <TokenBucketSvelteKit slot="sveltekit" />
</SlotByFramework>

## Identifying users

Rate limit rules use `characteristics` to identify the client and apply the
limit across requests. The default is to use the client's IP address. However,
you can specify other [characteristics](/fingerprints) such as a user ID or
other metadata from your application.

:::caution
Avoid passing personal information such as an email address as a custom
characteristic. The value is hashed on Arcjet's servers, but it's still a best
practice to avoid sending us sensitive information.
:::

In this example we define a rate limit rule that applies to a specific user ID.
The custom characteristic is `userId` with the value passed as a prop on the
`protect` function. You can use any string for the characteristic name and any
`string`, `number` or `boolean` for the value.

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <ByUserIdBun slot="bun" />
  <ByUserIdNestJs slot="nest-js" />
  <ByUserIdNextJs slot="next-js" />
  <ByUserIdNodeJs slot="node-js" />
  <ByUserIdRemix slot="remix" />
  <ByUserIdSvelteKit slot="sveltekit" />
</SlotByFramework>

To identify users with different characteristics e.g. IP address for anonymous
users and a user ID for logged in users, you can use `withRule` to create
augmented clients that use different characteristics. See the
[example in the custom characteristicssection](/rate-limiting/configuration#ip-address--user-id).

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <NestJsDecoratorRoutes slot="nest-js" />
  <NextJsPerRouteVsMiddleware slot="next-js" />
  <NextJsPagesServerActions slot="next-js" />
  <RemixLoaderVsAction slot="remix" />
  <SvelteKitPerRouteVsHooks slot="sveltekit" />
</SlotByFramework>

## Decision

Arcjet provides a single `protect` function that is used to execute your
protection rules. This requires a `RequestEvent` property which is the event
context as passed to the request handler.

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <NestJsGuardDecision slot="nest-js" />
</SlotByFramework>

This function returns a `Promise` that resolves to an
`ArcjetDecision` object. This contains the following properties:

- `id` (`string`) - The unique ID for the request. This can be used to look up
  the request in the Arcjet dashboard. It is prefixed with `req_` for decisions
  involving the Arcjet cloud API. For decisions taken locally, the prefix is
  `lreq_`.
- `conclusion` (`ArcjetConclusion`) - The final conclusion based on evaluating
  each of the configured rules. If you wish to accept Arcjet's recommended
  action based on the configured rules then you can use this property.
- `reason` (`ArcjetReason`) - An object containing more detailed
  information about the conclusion.
- `results` (`ArcjetRuleResult[]`) - An array of `ArcjetRuleResult` objects
  containing the results of each rule that was executed.
- `ip` (`ArcjetIpDetails`) - An object containing Arcjet's analysis of the
  client IP address. See the SDK reference for more information.

You check if a deny conclusion has been returned by a rate limit rule by using
`decision.isDenied()` and `decision.reason.isRateLimit()`.

You can iterate through the results and check whether a rate limit was applied:

```ts
for (const result of decision.results) {
  console.log("Rule Result", result);
}
```

This example will log the full result as well as each rate limit rule:

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <DecisionLogBun slot="bun" />
  <DecisionLogNestJs slot="nest-js" />
  <DecisionLogNextJs slot="next-js" />
  <DecisionLogNodeJs slot="node-js" />
  <DecisionLogRemix slot="remix" />
  <DecisionLogSvelteKit slot="sveltekit" />
</SlotByFramework>

### Token bucket request

When using a token bucket rule, an additional `requested` prop should be passed
to the `protect` function. This is the number of tokens the client is requesting
to withdraw from the bucket.

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <TokenBucketRequestBun slot="bun" />
  <TokenBucketRequestNestJs slot="nest-js" />
  <TokenBucketRequestNextJs slot="next-js" />
  <TokenBucketRequestNodeJs slot="node-js" />
  <TokenBucketRequestRemix slot="remix" />
  <TokenBucketRequestSvelteKit slot="sveltekit" />
</SlotByFramework>

### Rate limit headers

With a rate limit rule enabled, you can access additional metadata in every
Arcjet decision result:

- `max` (`number`): The configured maximum number of requests applied to this
  request.
- `remaining` (`number`): The number of requests remaining before `max` is
  reached within the window.
- `window` (`number`): The total amount of seconds in which requests are
  counted.
- `reset` (`number`): The remaining amount of seconds in the window.

These can be used to return `RateLimit` HTTP headers ([draft
RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpapi-ratelimit-headers-08)) to
offer the client more detail.

We provide the [@arcjet/decorate
package](https://github.com/arcjet/arcjet-js/tree/main/decorate) for decorating
your responses with appropriate `RateLimit` headers based on a decision.

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <HeadersBun slot="bun" />
  <HeadersNestJs slot="nest-js" />
  <HeadersNextJs slot="next-js" />
  <HeadersNodeJs slot="node-js" />
  <HeadersRemix slot="remix" />
  <HeadersSvelteKit slot="sveltekit" />
</SlotByFramework>

This would result in [draft
RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpapi-ratelimit-headers-08)
response headers similar to the following:

```http
...
< RateLimit: limit=10, remaining=5, reset=9
< RateLimit-Policy: 10;w=10
...
```

## Error handling

Arcjet is designed to fail open so that a service issue or misconfiguration does
not block all requests. The SDK will also time out and fail open after 1000ms
when `NODE_ENV` or `ARCJET_ENV` is `development` and 500ms otherwise. However,
in most cases, the response time will be less than 20-30ms.

If there is an error condition when processing the rule, Arcjet will return an
`ERROR` result for that rule and you can check the `message` property on the rule's
error result for more information.

If all other rules that were run returned an `ALLOW` result, then the final Arcjet
conclusion will be `ERROR`.

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <ErrorsBun slot="bun" />
  <ErrorsNestJs slot="nest-js" />
  <ErrorsNextJs slot="next-js" />
  <ErrorsNodeJs slot="node-js" />
  <ErrorsRemix slot="remix" />
  <ErrorsSvelteKit slot="sveltekit" />
</SlotByFramework>

## Testing

Arcjet runs the same in any environment, including locally and in CI. You can
use the `mode` set to `DRY_RUN` to log the results of rule execution without
blocking any requests.

We have an example test framework you can use to automatically test your rules.
Arcjet can also be triggered based using a sample of your traffic.

See the [Testing](/testing) section of the docs for details.
