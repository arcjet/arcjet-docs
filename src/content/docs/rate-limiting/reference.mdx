Arcjet rate limiting allows you to define rules which limit the number of
requests a client can make over a period of time.

## Configuration

Each rate limit is configured on an exact path with a set of client
characteristics and algorithm specific options.

### Fixed window rate limit options

Tracks the number of requests made by a client over a fixed time window. Options
are explained in the [Configuration](/rate-limiting/configuration)
documentation. See the [fixed window algorithm
description](/rate-limiting/algorithms#fixed-window) for more details about how
the algorithm works.

```ts
// Options for fixed window rate limit
// See https://docs.arcjet.com/rate-limiting/configuration
type FixedWindowRateLimitOptions = {
  // "LIVE" will block requests. "DRY_RUN" will log only
  mode?: "LIVE" | "DRY_RUN";
  // How the client is identified. We recommend setting characteristics on the
  // Arcjet client rather than per rule. Global characteristics default to the
  // request IP
  characteristics?: string[];
  // Time window the rate limit applies to
  window: string;
  // Maximum number of requests allowed in the time window
  max: number;
};
```

#### Fixed window example

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <FixedWindowBun slot="bun" />
  <FixedWindowNextJs slot="next-js" />
  <FixedWindowNodeJs slot="node-js" />
  <FixedWindowRemix slot="remix" />
  <FixedWindowSvelteKit slot="sveltekit" />
</SlotByFramework>

### Sliding window rate limit options

Tracks the number of requests made by a client over a sliding window so that the
window moves with time. Options are explained in the
[Configuration](/rate-limiting/configuration) documentation. See the [sliding
window algorithm description](/rate-limiting/algorithms#sliding-window) for more
details about how the algorithm works.

```ts
// Options for sliding window rate limit
// See https://docs.arcjet.com/rate-limiting/configuration
type SlidingWindowRateLimitOptions = {
  // "LIVE" will block requests. "DRY_RUN" will log only
  mode?: "LIVE" | "DRY_RUN";
  // How the client is identified. We recommend setting characteristics on the
  // Arcjet client rather than per rule. Global characteristics default to the
  // request IP
  characteristics?: string[];
  // The time interval in seconds for the rate limit
  interval: number;
  // Maximum number of requests allowed over the time interval
  max: number;
};
```

#### Sliding window example

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <SlidingWindowBun slot="bun" />
  <SlidingWindowNextJs slot="next-js" />
  <SlidingWindowNodeJs slot="node-js" />
  <SlidingWindowRemix slot="remix" />
  <SlidingWindowSvelteKit slot="sveltekit" />
</SlotByFramework>

### Token bucket rate limit options

Based on a bucket filled with a specific number of tokens. Each request
withdraws a token from the bucket and the bucket is refilled at a fixed rate.
Once the bucket is empty, the client is blocked until the bucket refills.
Options are explained in the [Configuration](/rate-limiting/configuration)
documentation. See the [token bucket algorithm
description](/rate-limiting/algorithms#token-bucket) for more details about how
the algorithm works.

```ts
// Options for token bucket rate limit
// See https://docs.arcjet.com/rate-limiting/configuration
type TokenBucketRateLimitOptions = {
  // "LIVE" will block requests. "DRY_RUN" will log only
  mode?: "LIVE" | "DRY_RUN";
  // How the client is identified. We recommend setting characteristics on the
  // Arcjet client rather than per rule. Global characteristics default to the
  // request IP
  characteristics?: string[];
  // Number of tokens to add to the bucket at each interval
  refillRate: number;
  // The interval in seconds to add tokens to the bucket
  interval: number;
  // The maximum number of tokens the bucket can hold
  capacity: number;
};
```

#### Token bucket example

See the [token bucket request example](#token-bucket-request) for how to specify
the number of tokens to request.

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <TokenBucketBun slot="bun" />
  <TokenBucketNextJs slot="next-js" />
  <TokenBucketNodeJs slot="node-js" />
  <TokenBucketRemix slot="remix" />
  <TokenBucketSvelteKit slot="sveltekit" />
</SlotByFramework>

## Identifying users

Rate limit rules use `characteristics` to identify the client and apply the
limit across requests. The default is to use the client's IP address. However,
you can specify other
[characteristics](/rate-limiting/configuration#characteristics) such as a user
ID or other metadata from your application.

:::caution
Avoid passing personal information such as an email address as a custom
characteristic. The value is hashed on Arcjet's servers, but it's still a best
practice to avoid sending us sensitive information.
:::

In this example we define a rate limit rule that applies to a specific user ID.
The custom characteristic is `userId` with the value passed as a prop on the
`protect` function. You can use any string for the characteristic name and any
`string`, `number` or `boolean` for the value.

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <ByUserIdBun slot="bun" />
  <ByUserIdNextJs slot="next-js" />
  <ByUserIdNodeJs slot="node-js" />
  <ByUserIdRemix slot="remix" />
  <ByUserIdSvelteKit slot="sveltekit" />
</SlotByFramework>

To identify users with different characteristics e.g. IP address for anonymous
users and a user ID for logged in users, you can create a custom fingerprint.
See the [example in the custom characteristics
section](/rate-limiting/configuration#ip-address--user-id).

## Rules

The `arcjet` client is configured with one or more rules which take one or many
of the above options.

### Example - single rate limit

Set a single rate limit rule on the `/api/hello` API route that applies a 60
request limit per hour per IP address (the default if no `characteristics` are
specified).

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <SingleRateLimitBun slot="bun" />
  <SingleRateLimitNextJs slot="next-js" />
  <SingleRateLimitNodeJs slot="node-js" />
  <SingleRateLimitRemix slot="remix" />
  <SingleRateLimitSvelteKit slot="sveltekit" />
</SlotByFramework>

### Example - dry run mode for new rules

Rate limits can be combined in the `arcjet` client which allows you to test new
configurations in dry run mode first before enabling them in live mode. You can
inspect the results of each rule by logging them or using the [Arcjet
Dashboard](https://app.arcjet.com).

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <DryRunBun slot="bun" />
  <DryRunNextJs slot="next-js" />
  <DryRunNodeJs slot="node-js" />
  <DryRunRemix slot="remix" />
  <DryRunSvelteKit slot="sveltekit" />
</SlotByFramework>

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <PerRouteVsMiddlewareNextJs slot="next-js" />
  <RemixLoaderVsAction slot="remix" />
  <PerRouteVsHooksSvelteKit slot="sveltekit" />
</SlotByFramework>

## Decision

Arcjet provides a single `protect` function that is used to execute your
protection rules. This requires a `RequestEvent` property which is the event
context as passed to the request handler.

This function returns a `Promise` that resolves to an
`ArcjetDecision` object. This contains the following properties:

- `id` (`string`) - The unique ID for the request. This can be used to look up
  the request in the Arcjet dashboard. It is prefixed with `req_` for decisions
  involving the Arcjet cloud API. For decisions taken locally, the prefix is
  `lreq_`.
- `conclusion` (`ArcjetConclusion`) - The final conclusion based on evaluating
  each of the configured rules. If you wish to accept Arcjet's recommended
  action based on the configured rules then you can use this property.
- `reason` (`ArcjetReason`) - An object containing more detailed
  information about the conclusion.
- `results` (`ArcjetRuleResult[]`) - An array of `ArcjetRuleResult` objects
  containing the results of each rule that was executed.
- `ip` (`ArcjetIpDetails`) - An object containing Arcjet's analysis of the
  client IP address. See the SDK reference for more information.

You check if a deny conclusion has been returned by a rate limit rule by using
`decision.isDenied()` and `decision.reason.isRateLimit()`.

You can iterate through the results and check whether a rate limit was applied:

```ts
for (const result of decision.results) {
  console.log("Rule Result", result);
}
```

This example will log the full result as well as each rate limit rule:

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <DecisionLogBun slot="bun" />
  <DecisionLogNextJs slot="next-js" />
  <DecisionLogNodeJs slot="node-js" />
  <DecisionLogRemix slot="remix" />
  <DecisionLogSvelteKit slot="sveltekit" />
</SlotByFramework>

### Token bucket request

When using a token bucket rule, an additional `requested` prop should be passed
to the `protect` function. This is the number of tokens the client is requesting
to withdraw from the bucket.

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <TokenBucketRequestBun slot="bun" />
  <TokenBucketRequestNextJs slot="next-js" />
  <TokenBucketRequestNodeJs slot="node-js" />
  <TokenBucketRequestRemix slot="remix" />
  <TokenBucketRequestSvelteKit slot="sveltekit" />
</SlotByFramework>

### Rate limit headers

With a rate limit rule enabled, you can access additional metadata in every
Arcjet decision result:

- `max` (`number`): The configured maximum number of requests applied to this
  request.
- `remaining` (`number`): The number of requests remaining before `max` is
  reached within the window.
- `window` (`number`): The total amount of seconds in which requests are
  counted.
- `reset` (`number`): The remaining amount of seconds in the window.

These can be used to return `RateLimit` HTTP headers ([draft
RFC](https://ietf-wg-httpapi.github.io/ratelimit-headers/draft-ietf-httpapi-ratelimit-headers.html)) to
offer the client more detail.

We provide the [@arcjet/decorate
package](https://github.com/arcjet/arcjet-js/tree/main/decorate) for decorating
your responses with appropriate `RateLimit` headers based on a decision.

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <HeadersBun slot="bun" />
  <HeadersNextJs slot="next-js" />
  <HeadersNodeJs slot="node-js" />
  <HeadersRemix slot="remix" />
  <HeadersSvelteKit slot="sveltekit" />
</SlotByFramework>

## Error handling

Arcjet is designed to fail open so that a service issue or misconfiguration does
not block all requests. The SDK will also time out and fail open after 1000ms
when `NODE_ENV` or `ARCJET_ENV` is `development` and 500ms otherwise. However,
in most cases, the response time will be less than 20-30ms.

If there is an error condition, Arcjet will return an `ERROR` `conclusion`.

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <ErrorsBun slot="bun" />
  <ErrorsNextJs slot="next-js" />
  <ErrorsNodeJs slot="node-js" />
  <ErrorsRemix slot="remix" />
  <ErrorsSvelteKit slot="sveltekit" />
</SlotByFramework>

## Testing

Arcjet runs the same in any environment, including locally and in CI. You can
use the `mode` set to `DRY_RUN` to log the results of rule execution without
blocking any requests.

We have an example test framework you can use to automatically test your rules.
Arcjet can also be triggered based using a sample of your traffic.

See the [Testing](/testing) section of the docs for details.
