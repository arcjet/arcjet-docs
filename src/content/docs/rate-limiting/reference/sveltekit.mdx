Arcjet rate limiting allows you to define rules which limit the number of
requests a client can make over a period of time.

## Configuration options

Each rate limit is configured on an exact path with a set of client
characteristics and algorithm specific options.

### Fixed window rate limit options

Tracks the number of requests made by a client over a fixed time window. Options
are explained in the [Configuration](/rate-limiting/configuration)
documentation. See the [fixed window algorithm
description](/rate-limiting/algorithms#fixed-window) for more details about how
the algorithm works.

```ts
// Options for fixed window rate limit
// See https://docs.arcjet.com/rate-limiting/configuration
type ConfigFixedWindowRateLimitOptions = {
  mode?: "LIVE" | "DRY_RUN"; // "LIVE" will block requests. "DRY_RUN" will log only
  match?: string; // request path the rate limit applies to
  characteristics?: string[]; // how the client is identified. Defaults to the global characteristics if unset
  window: string; // time window the rate limit applies to
  max: number; // maximum number of requests allowed in the time window
};
```

#### Fixed window example

<Code code={ConfigFixedWindow} lang="ts" />

### Sliding window rate limit options

Tracks the number of requests made by a client over a sliding window so that the
window moves with time. Options are explained in the
[Configuration](/rate-limiting/configuration) documentation. See the [sliding
window algorithm description](/rate-limiting/algorithms#sliding-window) for more
details about how the algorithm works.

```ts
// Options for sliding window rate limit
// See https://docs.arcjet.com/rate-limiting/configuration
type ConfigSlidingWindowRateLimitOptions = {
  mode?: "LIVE" | "DRY_RUN"; // "LIVE" will block requests. "DRY_RUN" will log only
  match?: string; // request path the rate limit applies to
  characteristics?: string[]; // how the client is identified. Defaults to the global characteristics if unset
  interval: number; // the time interval in seconds for the rate limit
  max: number; // maximum number of requests allowed over the time interval
};
```

#### Sliding window example

<Code code={ConfigSlidingWindow} lang="ts" />

### Token bucket rate limit options

Based on a bucket filled with a specific number of tokens. Each request
withdraws a token from the bucket and the bucket is refilled at a fixed rate.
Once the bucket is empty, the client is blocked until the bucket refills.
Options are explained in the [Configuration](/rate-limiting/configuration)
documentation. See the [token bucket algorithm
description](/rate-limiting/algorithms#token-bucket) for more details about how
the algorithm works.

```ts
// Options for token bucket rate limit
// See https://docs.arcjet.com/rate-limiting/configuration
type TokenBucketRateLimitOptions = {
  mode?: "LIVE" | "DRY_RUN"; // "LIVE" will block requests. "DRY_RUN" will log only
  match?: string; // request path the rate limit applies to
  characteristics?: string[]; // how the client is identified. Defaults to the global characteristics if unset
  refillRate: number; // number of tokens to add to the bucket at each interval
  interval: number; // the interval in seconds to add tokens to the bucket
  capacity: number; // the maximum number of tokens the bucket can hold
};
```

#### Token bucket example

See the [token bucket example](#token-bucket-request) for how to specify the
number of tokens to request.

<Code code={ConfigTokenBucket} lang="ts" />

## Identifying users

Rate limit rules use `characteristics` to identify the client and apply the
limit across requests. The default is to use the client's IP address. However,
you can specify other
[characteristics](/rate-limiting/configuration#characteristics) such as a user
ID or other metadata from your application.

:::caution
Avoid passing personal information such as an email address as a custom
characteristic. The value is hashed on Arcjet's servers, but it's still a best
practice to avoid sending us sensitive information.
:::

In this example we define a rate limit rule that applies to a specific user ID.
The custom characteristic is `userId` with the value passed as a prop on the
`protect` function. You can use any string for the characteristic name and any
`string`, `number` or `boolean` for the value.

      mark={[{ range: "12,22" }]}
    />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Rules

The `arcjet` client is configured with one or more rules which take one or many
of the above options.

### Example - single rate limit

Set a single rate limit rule on the `/api/arcjet` API route that applies a 60
request limit per hour per IP address (the default if no `characteristics` are
specified).

<Code code={SingleRateLimit} lang="ts" />

### Example - dry run mode for new rules

Rate limits can be combined in the `arcjet` client which allows you to test new
configurations in dry run mode first before enabling them in live mode. You can
inspect the results of each rule by logging them or using the [Arcjet
Dashboard](https://app.arcjet.com).

<Code code={DryRun} lang="ts" />

## Per route vs hooks

Rate limit rules can be configured in two ways:

- **Per route**: The rule is defined in the route handler itself. This allows
  you to configure the rule alongside the code it is protecting which is useful
  if you want to use the decision to add context to your own code. However, it
  means rules are not located in a single place.
- **Hooks**: The rule is defined as a hook. This allows you to
  configure rules in a single place or apply them globally to all routes, but
  it means the rules are not located alongside the code they are protecting.

### Per route

If you define your rate limit within a route and do not specify a value for
`match`, Arcjet assumes that the limit applies only to that route. If you define
your rate limit in hooks, you should specify a path for `match` otherwise
the rate limit will apply to all routes.

#### Rate limit only on `/api`

<Code
  code={HookSingleRoute}
  title="/src/hooks.server.ts"
  lang="ts"
  mark={[{ range: "10-11" }]}
/>

#### Rate limit on all routes

<Code
  code={HookAllRoutes}
  title="/src/hooks.server.ts"
  lang="ts"
  mark={[{ range: "10-11" }]}
/>

### Avoiding double protection with hooks

If you use Arcjet in hooks and individual routes, you need to be careful
that Arcjet is not running multiple times per request. This can be avoided by
excluding the individual routes before running Arcjet in the hook.

For example, if you already have a shield rule defined in the route
at `/api`, you can exclude it from the hook like this:

<Code
  code={HookMatcher}
  title="/src/hooks.server.ts"
  lang="ts"
  mark={[{ range: "23-29" }]}
/>

## Decision

Arcjet provides a single `protect` function that is used to execute your
protection rules. This requires a `RequestEvent` property which is the event
context as passed to the request handler.

This function returns a `Promise` that resolves to an
`ArcjetDecision` object. This contains the following properties:

- `id` (`string`) - The unique ID for the request. This can be used to look up
  the request in the Arcjet dashboard. It is prefixed with `req_` for decisions
  involving the Arcjet cloud API. For decisions taken locally, the prefix is
  `lreq_`.
- `conclusion` (`ArcjetConclusion`) - The final conclusion based on evaluating
  each of the configured rules. If you wish to accept Arcjet's recommended
  action based on the configured rules then you can use this property.
- `reason` (`ArcjetReason`) - An object containing more detailed
  information about the conclusion.
- `results` (`ArcjetRuleResult[]`) - An array of `ArcjetRuleResult` objects
  containing the results of each rule that was executed.
- `ip` (`ArcjetIpDetails`) - An object containing Arcjet's analysis of the
  client IP address. See [IP analysis](/reference/sveltekit/#ip-analysis) in the
  SDK reference for more information.

See [the SDK reference](/reference/nextjs#results) for more details about the
rule results.

You check if a deny conclusion has been returned by a rate limit rule by using
`decision.isDenied()` and `decision.reason.isRateLimit()`.

You can iterate through the results and check whether a rate limit was applied:

```ts
for (const result of decision.results) {
  console.log("Rule Result", result);
}
```

This example will log the full result as well as each rate limit rule:

      code={DecisionLogTS}
      title="/src/routes/api/arcjet/+server.ts"

      lang="js"
      mark={[{ range: "25-35" }]}
    />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Token bucket request

When using a token bucket rule, an additional `requested` prop should be passed
to the `protect` function. This is the number of tokens the client is requesting
to withdraw from the bucket.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="TS">
    <Code
      code={TokenBucketTS}
      title="/src/routes/api/arcjet/+server.ts"
      lang="ts"
      mark={[{ range: "8-14,19" }]}
    />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="JS">
    <Code
      code={TokenBucketJS}
      title="/src/routes/api/arcjet/+server.js"
      lang="js"
      mark={[{ range: "8-14,19" }]}
    />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Rate limit headers

With a rate limit rule enabled, you can access additional metadata in every
Arcjet decision result:

- `max` (`number`): The configured maximum number of requests applied to this
  request.
- `remaining` (`number`): The number of requests remaining before `max` is
  reached within the window.
- `window` (`number`): The total amount of seconds in which requests are
  counted.
- `reset` (`number`): The remaining amount of seconds in the window.

These can be used to return `RateLimit` HTTP headers ([draft
RFC](https://ietf-wg-httpapi.github.io/ratelimit-headers/draft-ietf-httpapi-ratelimit-headers.html)) to
offer the client more detail.

We provide the [@arcjet/decorate
package](https://github.com/arcjet/arcjet-js/tree/main/decorate) for decorating
your responses with appropriate `RateLimit` headers based on a decision.

  <TabItem label="TS">

    />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="JS">
    <Code

      lang="js"
      mark={[{ range: "2,26-27" }]}
    />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Error handling

Arcjet is designed to fail open so that a service issue or misconfiguration does
not block all requests. The SDK will also time out and fail open after 1000ms
when `NODE_ENV` or `ARCJET_ENV` is `development` and 500ms otherwise. However,
in most cases, the response time will be less than 20-30ms.

If there is an error condition, Arcjet will return an `ERROR` `conclusion`.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="TS">

<Code
  code={ErrorsTS}
  title="/src/routes/api/arcjet/+server.ts"
  lang="ts"
  mark={[{ range: "21-26" }]}
/>

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="JS">

<Code
  code={ErrorsJS}
  title="/src/routes/api/arcjet/+server.js"
  lang="js"
  mark={[{ range: "21-26" }]}
/>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Testing

Arcjet runs the same in any environment, including locally and in CI. You can
use the `mode` set to `DRY_RUN` to log the results of rule execution without
blocking any requests.

We have an example test framework you can use to automatically test your rules.
Arcjet can also be triggered based using a sample of your traffic.

See the [Testing](/testing) section of the docs for details.

## Examples

### Rate limit by IP address

The example below shows how to configure a rate limit on a single API route. It
applies a limit of 60 requests per hour per IP address. If the limit is
exceeded, the client is blocked for 10 minutes before being able to make any
further requests.

Applying a rate limit by IP address is the default if no
`characteristics` are specified.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="JS">

<Code code={ByIPJS} title="/src/routes/api/arcjet/+server.js" lang="js" />

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Rate limit by IP address with custom response

The example below is the same as the one above. However this example also shows
a customized response rather than the default

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="TS">

<Code
  code={ByIPCustomResponseTS}
  title="/src/routes/api/arcjet/+server.ts"
  lang="ts"
  mark={[{ range: "22-28" }]}
/>

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="JS">

<Code
  code={ByIPCustomResponseJS}
  title="/src/routes/api/arcjet/+server.js"
  lang="js"
  mark={[{ range: "22-28" }]}
/>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Rate limit by AI tokens

If you are building an AI application you may be more interested in the number
of AI tokens rather than the number of HTTP requests. Popular AI APIs such as
OpenAI are billed based on the number of tokens consumed and the number of
tokens is variable depending on the request e.g. conversation length or image
size.

The token bucket algorithm is a good fit for this use case because you can vary
the number of tokens withdrawn from the bucket with every request.

The example below configures a token bucket rate limit using the
[openai-chat-tokens library](https://github.com/hmarr/openai-chat-tokens) to
track the number of tokens used by a `gpt-3.5-turbo` AI chatbot. It sets a limit
of `2,000` tokens per hour with a maximum of `5,000` tokens in the bucket. This
allows for a reasonable conversation length without consuming too many tokens.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="TS">
    <Code
      code={AIChatBotTS}
      title="/src/routes/api/arcjet/+server.ts"
      lang="ts"
      mark={[{ range: "40-42,45" }]}
    />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="JS">
    <Code
      code={AIChatBotJS}
      title="/src/routes/api/arcjet/+server.ts"
      lang="js"
      mark={[{ range: "40-42,45" }]}
    />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can test this code with a `curl` request from the terminal:

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"messages":[{"role":"user", "content":"Hello world!"}]}' \
     http://localhost:5173/api/arcjet
```

### Rate limit by API key header

APIs are commonly protected by keys. You may wish to apply a rate limit based on
the key, regardless of which IPs the requests come from. To achieve this, you
can specify the characteristics Arcjet will use to track the limit.

The example below shows how to configure a rate limit on a single API route. It
applies a limit of 60 requests per hour per API key, where the key is provided
in a custom header called `x-api-key`. If the limit is exceeded, the client is
blocked for 10 minutes before being able to make any further requests.

:::caution
If you specify different characteristics and do not include `ip.src`, you may
inadvertently rate limit everyone. Be sure to include a characteristic which can
narrowly identify each client, such as an API key as shown here.
:::

<Code code={ByAPIKeyHeader} lang="ts" mark={[{ range: "9" }]} />

### Wildcard matching paths

The Arcjet rate limit `match` configuration does not currently support
wildcards. This is on our roadmap, but in the meantime you can use conditionals
in your SvelteKit hook instead.

<Code
  code={HookMatchingPaths}
  title="/src/hooks.server.ts"
  lang="ts"
  mark={[{ range: "23-24" }]}
/>

### Global rate limit

Using SvelteKit hooks allows you to set a rate limit that applies to every
route:

:::note
Hooks run on every route so be careful to [avoid double
protection](#avoiding-double-protection-with-hooks) if you are
configuring Arcjet directly on other routes.
:::

<Code code={HookGlobal} title="/src/hooks.server.ts" lang="ts" />

### Response based on the path

You can also use the `event`
[`RequestEvent`](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/types#public-types-requestevent)
object to customize the response based on the path. In this example, we'll
return a JSON response for API requests, and a HTML response for other requests.

<Code
  code={HookResponsePath}
  title="/src/hooks.server.ts"
  lang="ts"
  mark={[{ range: "26-30" }]}
/>

### Rewrite or redirect

The
[`NextResponse`](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/Hook#nextresponse)
object returned to the client can also be used to rewrite or redirect the
request. For example, you might want to return a JSON response for API route
requests, but redirect all page route requests to an error page.

<Code
  code={HookRewriteRedirect}
  title="/src/hooks.server.ts"
  lang="ts"
  mark={[{ range: "26-30" }]}
/>
