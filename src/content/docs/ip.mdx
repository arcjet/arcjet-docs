The Arcjet IP detection library provides a utility to find the public IP of a
Request.

<WhatAreArcjetUtilities />

## Why

The public IP of a Request is difficult to discern, but some platforms provide
specific mechanisms for accessing itâ€”such as the `X-Real-IP` header added or
overwritten by Vercel. The `@arcjet/ip` library provides a streamlined API over
these mechanisms based on the current platform.

:::caution[Considerations]
The IP should not be trusted as it can be spoofed in most cases, especially when
loaded via the `Headers` object. We apply additional platform guards if a
platform is supplied in the `options` argument.

If a private/internal address is encountered, it will be skipped. If only those
are detected, an empty string is returned.
:::

## Install

```sh
npm install -S @arcjet/ip
```

## Usage

import IpUsage from "@/snippets/ip/usage.ts?raw";

<Code code={IpUsage} lang="ts" />

### Platform protections

Additional guards can be applied with the `platform` option, such as
`{ platform: "fly-io" }`, `{ platform: "cloudflare" }`, or
`{ platform: "vercel" }`.

import IpPlatform from "@/snippets/ip/platform.ts?raw";

<Code code={IpPlatform} lang="ts" />

### Proxy filtering

Most proxies will add themselves in the chain of public IP addresses. Trusted
proxies may be specified with the `proxies` option, and they will be
ignored when detecting a public IP.

import IpProxies from "@/snippets/ip/proxies.ts?raw";

<Code code={IpProxies} lang="ts" />

## API

### `ip(request: RequestLike, options?: Options)`

Look up an IP address in a Request-like object, such as `Request`, Node's
`http.IncomingMessage`, or Next.js' `NextRequest`.

**Types:**

<DisplayType type="RequestLike" from="@arcjet/ip" />
<DisplayType type="Options" from="@arcjet/ip" />
<DisplayType type="Platform" from="@arcjet/ip" />

## What next?

Arcjet can protect your entire app or individual routes with just
a few lines of code. Using the main Arcjet SDK you can setup bot protection,
rate limiting for your API, minimize fraudulent registrations with the
signup form protection and more.
