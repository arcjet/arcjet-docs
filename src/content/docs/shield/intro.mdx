With Arcjet shield WAF you can protect your application against common attacks,
including the [OWASP Top 10][owasp-top-10].

Shield is useful as it is a fully-managed service that tracks requests over time.
An attacker may look for a WordPress admin panel,
an accidentally uploaded `.git` directory,
`.env` file,
or a login form.
Separately these requests seem innocent but together they form a suspicious
pattern.
Clients are blocked when they exceed a certain threshold.

Other platforms also provide WAFs.
However they sit in front of your application without context.
With Arcjet you can for example customize errors or flag accounts,
as it sits inside your application logic,
instead of only blocking requests.
With Arcjet you do not need any infrastructure (such as Redis) to keep track of
state.

## When to use

You can use Shield WAF to protect your application against common attacks.

Shield WAF is for requests that seem innocent when taken separately but form
suspicious traffic when taken together.
You can use the other Arcjet rules,
such as [Arcjet Bot protection][arcjet-bot-protection]
or [Arcjet Filters][arcjet-filters],
when you can judge individual requests,
or [Arcjet Rate limiting][arcjet-rate-limiting],
to impose a hard limit.

## How it works

Arcjet tracks metadata about each request (importantly _not_ the body).
Over time,
sometimes hundreds of requests,
patterns become visible in this data.
When a client exceeds a certain threshold of suspicious requests,
they will be blocked.

Tracking happens in the Arcjet Cloud API and does not require any additional
infrastructure such as Redis.
The included latest rules from the [OWASP Core Rule Set][core-ruleset] protect
against common attack categories such as:

- SQL injection (SQLi)
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Local file inclusion (LFI)
- Remote file inclusion (RFI)
- PHP code injection
- Java code injection
- HTTPoxy
- Shellshock
- Unix/Windows shell injection
- Session fixation

Clients are tracked by [fingerprints][arcjet-fingerprints] that include
IP addresses by default.
This means that clients using the same IP address are counted and blocked.
To ensure that this rule is applied correctly it is important to carefully
select characteristics,
such as a specific HTTP header or an authentication token,
to match your concept of “user”.

## Availability

Basic protection from common attacks is available on the free plan.
Additional protection including the latest rules from the
[OWASP Core Rule Set][core-ruleset] (CRS) is available on paid plans.
