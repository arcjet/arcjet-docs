Arcjet Shield protects your application against common attacks, including the
[OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/).

## Quick start

This guide will show you how to configure Arcjet for a Bun app.

### 1. Install SDK

In your project root, run the following command to install the SDK:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```sh
bun add @arcjet/bun
```

### 2. Set your key

[Create a free Arcjet account](https://app.arcjet.com) then follow the
instructions to add a site and get a key. Add it to a `.env.local` file in your
Bun project root.

Arcjet only accept non-local IP addresses with a fallback to 127.0.0.1 in development mode, and since Bun
doesn't set `NODE_ENV` for you like Node.js does, you also need to set
`ARCJET_ENV` in your environment file.

```ini title=".env.local"
# Run Arcjet in development mode because Bun.sh doesn't explicitly
# set an environment variable like Node.js does
ARCJET_ENV=development
ARCJET_KEY=ajkey_yourkey
```

### 3. Protect a route

This example shows how to protect your app with Arcjet Shield.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="TS">
    <Code code={Step3TS} lang="ts" title="/index.ts" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="JS">
    <Code code={Step3JS} lang="js" title="/src/index.js" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 4. Start app

Start your app and load `http://localhost:3000`. Refresh the page and you will
see the requests showing up in the [Arcjet dashboard](https://app.arcjet.com).
Your entire application is protected.

### 5. Simulate a suspicious request

To see Arcjet Shield in action, try making a request with the special header
`x-arcjet-suspicious` set to `true`. After 5 requests, Arcjet Shield will be
triggered and will block the request. This simulates the threshold being
reached and is a constant, so you can use it as part of your tests.

<Aside type="caution" title="This will block your client">
  Running this simulation will trigger Arcjet Shield and block your client for
  15 minutes. The ability to configure this threshold and manage blocked clients
  is coming soon.
</Aside>

```sh
curl -v -H "x-arcjet-suspicious: true" http://localhost:3000
```

The default response for a blocked request is a 403 Forbidden which you will see
when you make the 6th request:

```sh
# ...5 requests made previously
curl -v -H "x-arcjet-suspicious: true" http://localhost:3000
...
> GET / HTTP/2
> Host: localhost:3000
> User-Agent: curl/8.4.0
> Accept: */*
> x-arcjet-suspicious: true

## What next?

Arcjet can be used with specific rules on individual routes or as general
protection on your entire application. You can customize bot protection, rate
limiting for your API and minimize fraudulent registrations with the signup form
protection.
