Arcjet Shield protects your application against common attacks, including the
[OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/).

## Configuration

Shield is configured by specifying which mode you want it to run in.

The configuration definition is:

```ts
type ShieldOptions = {
  mode?: "LIVE" | "DRY_RUN";
};
```

The `arcjet` client is configured with one or more `shield` rules which take
one or many `ShieldOptions`.

:::note
When specifying multiple rules, the order of the rules is ignored. Rule
execution ordering is automatically optimized for performance. See
[decision](#decision) below for details of examining the execution results.

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <PerRouteVsMiddlewareNextJs slot="next-js" />
  <PerRouteVsHooksSvelteKit slot="sveltekit" />
</SlotByFramework>

## Decision

The [quick start example](/shield/quick-start?f=nextjs) will deny requests
that are determined to be suspicious, immediately returning a response to the
client using Next.js middleware.

Arcjet also provides a single `protect` function that is used to execute your
protection rules. This requires a `request` argument which is the request
context as passed to the request handler.

This function returns a `Promise` that resolves to an
`ArcjetDecision` object. This contains the following properties:

- `id` (`string`) - The unique ID for the request. This can be used to look up
  the request in the Arcjet dashboard. It is prefixed with `req_` for decisions
  involving the Arcjet cloud API. For decisions taken locally, the prefix is
  `lreq_`.
- `conclusion` (`ArcjetConclusion`) - The final conclusion based on evaluating
  each of the configured rules. If you wish to accept Arcjet's recommended
  action based on the configured rules then you can use this property.
- `reason` (`ArcjetReason`) - An object containing more detailed
  information about the conclusion.
- `results` (`ArcjetRuleResult[]`) - An array of `ArcjetRuleResult` objects
  containing the results of each rule that was executed.
- `ip` (`ArcjetIpDetails`) - An object containing Arcjet's analysis of the
  client IP address. See the SDK reference for more information.

See [the SDK reference](/reference/nextjs#results) for more details about the
rule results.

You check if a deny conclusion has been returned by a shield rule by using
`decision.isDenied()` and `decision.reason.isShield()` respectively.

You can iterate through the results and check whether a shield rule was applied:

```ts
for (const result of decision.results) {
  console.log("Rule Result", result);
}
```

This example will log the full result as well as the shield rule:

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <DecisionLogBun slot="bun" />
  <DecisionLogNextJs slot="next-js" />
  <DecisionLogNodeJs slot="node-js" />
  <DecisionLogSvelteKit slot="sveltekit" />
</SlotByFramework>

## Error handling

Arcjet is designed to fail open so that a service issue or misconfiguration does
not block all requests. The SDK will also time out and fail open after 1000ms
when `NODE_ENV` or `ARCJET_ENV` is `development` and 500ms otherwise. However,
in most cases, the response time will be less than 20-30ms.

If there is an error condition, Arcjet will return an
`ERROR` type and you can check the `reason` property for more information, like
accessing `decision.reason.message`.

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <ErrorsBun slot="bun" />
  <ErrorsNextJs slot="next-js" />
  <ErrorsNodeJs slot="node-js" />
  <ErrorsSvelteKit slot="sveltekit" />
</SlotByFramework>

## Testing

Arcjet runs the same in any environment, including locally and in CI. You can
use the `mode` set to `DRY_RUN` to log the results of rule execution without
blocking any requests.

We have an example test framework you can use to automatically test your rules.
Arcjet can also be triggered based using a sample of your traffic.

See the [Testing](/testing) section of the docs for details.
