Arcjet Shield WAF protects your application against common web attacks,
including the [OWASP Top 10][owasp-top-10], by analyzing requests over time and
blocking clients that show suspicious behavior.

<WhatIsArcjet />

Shield is a fully managed, application-aware web application firewall. It tracks
request metadata over time so it can detect patterns that look benign in
isolation but malicious when combined. An attacker might probe for a WordPress
admin panel, an accidentally uploaded `.git` directory, a `.env` file, or a
login form. Each request alone looks harmless, but together they form a clear
attack pattern. Arcjet blocks clients when they exceed a threshold.

Other platforms also provide WAFs, but they usually sit in front of your
application without access to your business logic. Arcjet Shield runs as part of
the Arcjet SDK inside your application, so you can customize responses, flag
accounts, or trigger additional checks instead of only blocking requests. You do
not need any additional infrastructure.

## When to use Arcjet Shield

Use Arcjet Shield WAF to protect your application from common web attacks and
suspicious probing behavior that only becomes obvious over time.

Shield is most effective for requests that seem innocent when taken individually
but form suspicious traffic when seen together. Examples:

- Repeated requests for admin panels or well-known login paths.
- Scans for backup files, configuration files, or version control directories.
- Probing for injection vulnerabilities using crafted query strings or payloads.

We recommend using Arcjet Shield WAF alongside other Arcjet features such as:

- [Arcjet bot protection][arcjet-bot-protection] to detect and control bot
  traffic.
- [Arcjet filters][arcjet-filters] to apply custom per-request rules.
- [Arcjet rate limiting][arcjet-rate-limiting] to impose hard limits on request
  volume.

## How Arcjet Shield works

Arcjet tracks metadata about each request (importantly, **not** the body) over time.
When a client exceeds a threshold of suspicious requests, they are marked as
malicious and can be blocked or handled differently in your application.

Tracking happens in the Arcjet Cloud API and does not require any additional
infrastructure. State is shared across all instances of your
application.

### Rules and the OWASP Core Rule Set

Shield includes the latest rules from the [OWASP Core Rule Set][core-ruleset],
which protect against common attack categories such as:

- SQL injection (SQLi)
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Local file inclusion (LFI)
- Remote file inclusion (RFI)
- PHP code injection
- Java code injection
- HTTPoxy
- Shellshock
- Unix/Windows shell injection
- Session fixation

These rules provide broad coverage of known attack patterns and are combined
with Arcjet's own analysis of request patterns over time.

### Fingerprints and your concept of “user”

Clients are tracked by configurable [fingerprints][arcjet-fingerprints] that
include IP addresses by default. This means that clients using the same IP
address are counted and may be blocked together.

To ensure Shield behaves correctly, choose fingerprint characteristics that
match your concept of a "user". For example:

- IP address only (per-IP behavior).
- IP + authentication token (per logged-in user).
- API key or client ID (per-client behavior for APIs).

Aligning fingerprints with the right identifiers avoids blocking the wrong users
and makes Shield's decisions more meaningful.

### Responding to suspicious requests

When a request is blocked by Arcjet Shield WAF, the Arcjet SDK includes detailed
information in the decision returned to your application. You can simply accept
the default and block the client, or customize the response.

For example:

- On user-facing pages, you might return a friendly error page.
- In an API, you might return a structured error that fits your JSON or XML
  schema.
- In critical flows such as checkout or sensitive account actions, you might log
  the request context, flag the account for review, or require additional
  verification in case the request came from a legitimate user.

Generic, network-level protections are often insufficient for modern
applications where context and sensitivity vary across routes and features.
Arcjet Shield gives developers request-level security with application context,
without sacrificing usability.

## Is Arcjet Shield a Web Application Firewall (WAF)?

Yes. Arcjet Shield is a Web Application Firewall because it inspects every
request for possible attacks and applies security rules to those requests.

Traditional WAFs, however, have several problems:

1. They are often slow, adding significant latency to every request.
2. They sit in front of your production application and are hard to run locally
   or in test environments. Turning them on or changing rules can be risky
   because you cannot test them properly.
3. They are separate systems with no context about your application, so their
   decisions cannot easily be used as part of your application logic (for
   example, customizing errors or flagging accounts instead of just blocking).
4. They have a high false positive rate, blocking legitimate users and
   frustrating customers.

Arcjet Shield solves these problems by being part of the Arcjet SDK, integrated
into your application while running analysis on the Arcjet platform so it
consumes no resources from your app. The threshold-based approach helps reduce
false positives.

Because Shield runs alongside your code, engineers can integrate results into
application logic, control how suspicious requests are handled, and test
behavior locally and in staging before deploying to production.

## Availability

Basic protection from common attacks is available on the free plan. Additional
protection including the latest rules from the [OWASP Core Rule
Set][core-ruleset] (CRS) is available on paid plans.
