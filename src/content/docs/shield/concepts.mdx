Arcjet Shield WAF protects your application against common attacks, including
the [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/).

### Responding to suspicious requests

When a request is blocked by Arcjet Shield WAF, the Arcjet SDK includes the
details in the response to your application. You can simply accept the default
and block the client. However, you can also customize the response to suit your
application.

For example, on critical user-facing website pages you might want to return an
error page. In an API you might want to return a formatted response that follows
your API schema in JSON or XML. And in critical application flows such as a
checkout or sensitive action you might store the request context and flag the
account for review in case it's a legitimate user.

Generic, network-level protections are insufficient for modern applications
where the context and sensitivity changes across the application. Arcjet allows
developers to build with security in mind without sacrificing usability.

## Is Arcjet Shield a Web Application Firewall (WAF)?

Yes, we call Arcjet Shield a Web Application Firewall (WAF) because it analyzes
every request for possible attacks. However, there are several problems with
traditional WAFs:

1. They are slow, often adding hundreds of milliseconds to every request.
2. They sit in front of your production application and are difficult to deploy
   locally or in test environments. This means turning them on or changing rules
   is risky because you can't test them properly. Engineers only get involved
   when something breaks rather than being able to test them during development.
3. This also means WAFs are a separate system with no context about your
   application. Therefore, the results can't be used as part of your application
   logic e.g. customizing errors or flagging accounts, rather than just blocking
   requests.
4. They have a high false positive rate, blocking legitimate users and
   frustrating customers.

Arcjet Shield solves these problems by being part of the Arcjet SDK integrated
into your application, but running analysis on the Arcjet platform so it
consumes no resources from your application. Using a threshold system allows
false positives to be minimized.

Finally, you can integrate the results into your application logic which allows
you to control how you handle suspicious requests. This allows engineers to test
everything locally and in staging, avoiding the risk of breaking production.
