Arcjet Shield protects your application against common attacks, including the
[OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/).

## Configuration

Shield is configured by specifying which mode you want it to run in.

The configuration definition is:

```ts
type ShieldOptions = {
  mode?: "LIVE" | "DRY_RUN";
};
```

The `arcjet` client is configured with one or more `shield` rules which take
one or many `ShieldOptions`.

:::note
When specifying multiple rules, the order of the rules is ignored. Rule
execution ordering is automatically optimized for performance. See
[decision](#decision) below for details of examining the execution results.

## Decision

The [quick start example](/shield/quick-start/bun) will deny requests
that are determined to be suspicious, immediately returning a response to the
client.

Arcjet also provides a single `protect` function that is used to execute your
protection rules. This requires a `request` argument which is the request
context as passed to the request handler.

This function returns a `Promise` that resolves to an
`ArcjetDecision` object. This contains the following properties:

- `id` (`string`) - The unique ID for the request. This can be used to look up
  the request in the Arcjet dashboard. It is prefixed with `req_` for decisions
  involving the Arcjet cloud API. For decisions taken locally, the prefix is
  `lreq_`.
- `conclusion` (`ArcjetConclusion`) - The final conclusion based on evaluating
  each of the configured rules. If you wish to accept Arcjet's recommended
  action based on the configured rules then you can use this property.
- `reason` (`ArcjetReason`) - An object containing more detailed
  information about the conclusion.
- `results` (`ArcjetRuleResult[]`) - An array of `ArcjetRuleResult` objects
  containing the results of each rule that was executed.
- `ip` (`ArcjetIpDetails`) - An object containing Arcjet's analysis of the
  client IP address. See [IP analysis](/reference/bun#ip-analysis) in the
  SDK reference for more information.

See [the SDK reference](/reference/bun#results) for more details about the
rule results.

You check if a deny conclusion has been returned by a shield rule by using
`decision.isDenied()` and `decision.reason.isShield()` respectively.

You can iterate through the results and check whether a shield rule was applied:

```ts
for (const result of decision.results) {
  console.log("Rule Result", result);
}
```

This example will log the full result as well as the shield rule:

## Error handling

Arcjet is designed to fail open so that a service issue or misconfiguration does
not block all requests. The SDK will also time out and fail open after 500ms
when `ARCJET_ENV` is `"production"` and 1000ms otherwise. However, in most cases,
the response time will be less than 20-30ms.

If there is an error condition, Arcjet will return an
`ERROR` type and you can check the `reason` property for more information, like
accessing `decision.reason.message`.
