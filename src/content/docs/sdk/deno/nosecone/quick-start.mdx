Arcjet Nosecone is an [open source library](https://github.com/arcjet/arcjet-js)
that helps set security headers such as `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP),
`Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS), and `X-Content-Type-Options` in JS
applications built with Bun, Deno, Next.js, Node.js, or SvelteKit.

## Supported headers

Nosecone makes it easy to add and configure these headers:

- `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP)
- `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy` (COEP)
- `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy`
- `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy`
- `Origin-Agent-Cluster`
- `Referrer-Policy`
- `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS)
- `X-Content-Type-Options`
- `X-DNS-Prefetch-Control`
- `X-Download-Options`
- `X-Frame-Options`
- `X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies`
- `X-XSS-Protection`

See the [reference guide](/nosecone/reference) for full details on each option.

:::note
If you are using Express, NestJS, or Remix we recommend using the excellent
[Helmet](https://helmetjs.github.io/) library, which informed much of our work
on Nosecone.

## Quick start

This guide will show you how to add our recommended Deno
default security headers.

### 1. Install Nosecone

In your project root, run the following command to install the Arcjet Nosecone
library for your framework:

<Step1 />

### 2. Configure your application

<Step2 />

### 3. Run your application

<Step3 />

### 4. Inspect the headers

The default headers apply a pragmatic set of security headers to your
application, but may break things (particularly the CSP header).

We recommend you test your application thoroughly and tweak the settings to
ensure it continues to work as expected.

Arcjet can protect your entire app or individual routes with just
a few lines of code. Using the main Arcjet SDK you can setup bot protection,
rate limiting for your API, minimize fraudulent registrations with the
signup form protection and more.
