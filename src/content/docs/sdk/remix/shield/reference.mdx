Arcjet Shield WAF protects your application against common attacks, including
the [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/).

## Configuration

Shield is configured by specifying which mode you want it to run in.

The `arcjet` client can be configured with one or more Shield rules, which are
constructed with the `shield(options: ShieldOptions)` function and configured by
`ShieldOptions`:

<DisplayType type="ShieldOptions" from="@arcjet/remix" />
<DisplayType type="ArcjetMode" from="@arcjet/remix" />

:::note
When specifying multiple rules, the order of the rules is ignored. Rule
execution ordering is automatically optimized for performance. See
[decision](#decision) below for details of examining the execution results.

## Decision

Arcjet provides a single `protect` function that is used to execute your
protection rules. This requires a `RequestEvent` property which is the event
context as passed to the request handler.

This function returns a `Promise` that resolves to an
`ArcjetDecision` object. This contains the following properties:

- `id` (`string`) - The unique ID for the request. This can be used to look up
  the request in the Arcjet dashboard. It is prefixed with `req_` for decisions
  involving the Arcjet cloud API. For decisions taken locally, the prefix is
  `lreq_`.
- `conclusion` (`ArcjetConclusion`) - The final conclusion based on evaluating
  each of the configured rules. If you wish to accept Arcjet's recommended
  action based on the configured rules then you can use this property.
- `reason` (`ArcjetReason`) - An object containing more detailed
  information about the conclusion.
- `results` (`ArcjetRuleResult[]`) - An array of `ArcjetRuleResult` objects
  containing the results of each rule that was executed.
- `ip` (`ArcjetIpDetails`) - An object containing Arcjet's analysis of the
  client IP address. See the SDK reference for more information.

You check if a deny conclusion has been returned by a shield rule by using
`decision.isDenied()` and `decision.reason.isShield()` respectively.

You can iterate through the results and check whether a shield rule was applied:

```ts
for (const result of decision.results) {
  console.log("Rule Result", result);
}
```

This example will log the full result as well as the shield rule:

## Error handling

Arcjet is designed to fail open so that a service issue or misconfiguration does
not block all requests. The SDK will also time out and fail open after 1000ms in
development (see [`ARCJET_ENV`](/environment#arcjet-env)) and 500ms
otherwise. However, in most cases, the response time will be less than 20-30ms.

If there is an error condition when processing the rule, Arcjet will return an
`ERROR` result for that rule and you can check the `message` property on the rule's
error result for more information.

If all other rules that were run returned an `ALLOW` result, then the final Arcjet
conclusion will be `ERROR`.

<Errors />

## Testing

Arcjet runs the same in any environment, including locally and in CI. You can
use the `mode` set to `DRY_RUN` to log the results of rule execution without
blocking any requests.

We have an example test framework you can use to automatically test your rules.
Arcjet can also be triggered based using a sample of your traffic.

See the [Testing](/testing) section of the docs for details.
