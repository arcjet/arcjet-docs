## Quick start

This guide will show you how to add a simple rate limit to your Remix app.

### 1. Install Arcjet

<Step1 />

### 2. Set your key

[Create a free Arcjet account](https://app.arcjet.com) then follow the
instructions to add a site and get a key.

<Step2 />

### 3. Add a rate limit to a route

The example below applies a token bucket rate limit rule to a route where we
identify the user based on their ID e.g. if they are logged in. The bucket is
configured with a maximum capacity of 10 tokens and refills by 5 tokens every
10 seconds. Each request consumes 5 tokens.

<Step4 />

The requests will also show in the [Arcjet dashboard](https://app.arcjet.com).
