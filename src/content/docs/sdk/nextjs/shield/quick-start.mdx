<Step3 />

<Step4 />

### 5. Simulate a suspicious request

To see Arcjet Shield WAF in action, try making a request with the special header
`x-arcjet-suspicious` set to `true`. After 5 requests, Arcjet Shield will be
triggered and will block the request. This simulates the threshold being reached
and is a constant, so you can use it as part of your tests.

<Step5 />

The requests will also show in the [Arcjet dashboard](https://app.arcjet.com).
