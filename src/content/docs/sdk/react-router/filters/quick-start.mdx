Arcjet filters let you block requests using
[Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/)-like [display
filter](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/ChWorkBuildDisplayFilterSection.html)
expressions over HTTP headers, IP addresses, and other request fields. This
allows you to quickly enforce rules like allow/deny by country, network, or
`user-agent`.

## Quick start

This guide shows how to protect your React Router app with
filters.

### 1. Install Arcjet

Run the following command to install the SDK in your project:

<Step1 />

### 2. Set your key

[Create a free Arcjet account](https://app.arcjet.com) and follow the
instructions to add a site and get a key.

<Step2 />

### 3. Add filters

<Step3 />

{/* Note: Step 4 has its heading inside it as it is dynamic. Make sure that the table of contents (in frontmatter) reflects that dynamic heading correctly. */}

<Step4 />

### 5. Try it out

Make a `curl` request from your terminal to your app:

```sh
curl --head http://localhost:5173
```

You should get a `403 Forbidden` response.

The Curl request could result in a `200 OK` if you have a `.curlrc` somewhere
(probably `~/.curlrc`) that sets a `user-agent` field to something other than
Curl.

Try changing the filter expression to match `"chrome"` or `"firefox"` and visit
your app with different browsers.

These requests should also show in the [Arcjet dashboard][arcjet-dashboard].
Make sure you configured `ARCJET_KEY` correctly if things don't show up.

See the [Filters reference][arcjet-filters-reference] to learn more about the
expression language.

Arcjet can be used with specific rules on individual routes or as general
protection on your entire application. You can setup rate limiting for your
API, minimize fraudulent registrations with the signup form protection and more.
