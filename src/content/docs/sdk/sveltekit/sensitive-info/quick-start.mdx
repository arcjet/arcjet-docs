Arcjet Sensitive Information Detection protects against clients sending you
sensitive information such as personally identifiable information (PII) that
you do not wish to handle.

## Quick start

This guide will show you how to configure Arcjet for a SvelteKit
app.

### 1. Install Arcjet

In your project root, run the following command to install the SDK:

<Step1 />

### 2. Set your key

[Create a free Arcjet account](https://app.arcjet.com) then follow the
instructions to add a site and get a key. Add it to a `.env.local` file in your
project root.

<Step2 />

### 3. Protect a route

Create a sensitive info detection rule. You can also configure Arcjet to detect
credit/debit card numbers, IP addresses, phone numbers, and/or implement a
custom detection function. See the [reference](/sensitive-info/reference) for
details.

<Step3 />

### 4. Test sending personal info

Start your app and try making a request with an email address in the body of the
request:

<Step4 />

You should see this in your logs

```text
Arcjet decision ArcjetDenyDecision {
  id: '', // This will contain the Arcjet request ID
  ttl: 0,
  results: [
    ArcjetRuleResult {
      ruleId: '',
      ttl: 0,
      state: 'RUN',
      conclusion: 'DENY',
      reason: [ArcjetSensitiveInfoReason]
    }
  ],
...
```

The default response for a request containing unexpected sensitive information
is a 400:

```sh
< HTTP/2 400
< content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8
< date: Tue, 09 Jan 2024 13:43:04 GMT
< vary: Accept-Encoding
< content-length: 72
```

The requests will also show in the [Arcjet dashboard](https://app.arcjet.com).

Arcjet can be used with specific rules on individual routes or as general
protection on your entire application. You can setup bot protection, rate
limiting for your API, minimize fraudulent registrations with the signup form
protection and more.
