Arcjet allows you to validate & verify an email address. This is useful for
preventing users from signing up with fake email addresses and can significantly
reduce the amount of spam or fraudulent accounts.

## How it works

### Step 1: Validation

The first step is to validate the email address syntax. This runs locally
within the SDK and validates the email address is in the correct format.
Validation is performed against several RFCs with modifications to exclude email
addresses you wouldn't expect signing up to a real application e.g. local
domains.

Two of the validation options are configurable: whether 2 parts of the domain
are required (defaults to being required) and whether domain literals in the
form of `example@[127.0.0.1]` are allowed (defaults to not being allowed).
Configuring these is described within the SDK documentation.

Internally, validation is implemented using the open source
[`email_address`](https://github.com/arcjet/email_address) Crate.

#### Validation errors

If an email address fails validation, one of the following errors will be
provided:

#### Configurable

- `MissingTopLevelDomain`: The email address didn't contain at least 2 domain
  segments - it must contain at least the domain name and TLD.
- `InvalidDomainLiteral`: Domain literals (e.g. `foo@[123.456.789.0]`) are not
  supported but one was provided.

#### Non-configurable

- `MissingSeparator`: The `@` character was missing between the local part and
  domain.
- `InvalidCharacter`: The email address contained an invalid character.
- `LocalPartEmpty`: The local part of the email address must contain at least 1
  character.
- `LocalPartTooLong` The local part has a max-length of 64 characters, as per
  [RFC3696](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3696#section-3)
- `DomainEmpty`: The domain of the email address must contain at least 1
  character.
- `DomainTooLong`: The domain has a max-length of 254 characters, as per
  [RFC3696 errata
  1690](https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata_search.php?rfc=3696&eid=1690)
- `SubDomainEmpty` One or more domain segments, separated by the `.` character,
  are empty.
- `SubDomainTooLong` One or more domain segments, separated by the `.`
  character, are longer than 63 characters, as per
  [RFC1034](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1034#section-3.5)

### Step 2: Verification

If the email syntax is valid, the SDK will pass the email address to the Arcjet
cloud API to verify the email address. This performs several checks:

- MX validation: Checks if the domain has valid MX records.
- Email type: Checks if the email address is a free, disposable or role-based
  email address.
- Has Gravatar: Checks if the email address has a
  [Gravatar](https://gravatar.com) image associated with it. This is useful for
  checking if the email address is a real person.

This metadata is returned as part of the Arcjet SDK response so you can decide
what to do next. For example, you might decide to block signups from domains
without MX records and from disposable email addresses, but add a flag to
manually review those from free email providers.

#### Email types

The Arcjet SDK will provide an analysis of the email type, returning one or
several of the following:

- **Disposable:** The email address is disposable, which means it's registered to a
  service that allows throwaway email addresses. Although these are sometimes
  used for privacy, they are also often used for spam signups or fraudulent
  activity when combined with a transaction e.g. attempting to use a credit
  card. We recommend blocking these in higher risk scenarios.
- **Free:** The email address is registered to a free email service. These are very
  common, such as GMail or Yahoo Mail, so we do not recommend blocking these.
  However, you may wish to flag these for review the first time they attempt a
  transaction.
- **No MX records:** This email address is registered to a domain name which has
  no MX records configured. This means it cannot receive email. We recommend
  blocking these.
- **No Gravatar**: This email has no Gravatar attached to the email from which
  makes it slightly less likely to be a valid signup. This can be used for your
  own risk scoring or to trigger a manual review.

## Configuration

Email validation is configured by specifying the email types you wish to allow
or deny, and whether you wish to modify certain validation options.

The `arcjet` client can be configured with one or more Email validation rules,
which are constructed with the `validateEmail(options: EmailOptions)` function
and configured by `EmailOptions`:

<DisplayType type="EmailOptions" from="@arcjet/nest" />
<DisplayType type="ArcjetMode" from="@arcjet/nest" />
<DisplayType type="ArcjetEmailType" from="@arcjet/nest" />

<Aside type="note">
  When specifying multiple rules, the order of the rules is ignored. Rule
  execution ordering is automatically optimized for performance. See
  [decision](#decision) below for details of examining the execution results.
</Aside>

The `allow`and `deny` lists are mutually-exclusive, such that using `allow` will
result in a `DENY` decision for any email type that is not specified in the
`allow` list and using `deny` will result in an `ALLOW` decision for any email
type that is not specified in the `deny` list.

The validation options can usually be left as the defaults. However, if you wish
to allow certain types of email addresses, you can modify the options:

- `requireTopLevelDomain`: Whether or not to allow email addresses that don't
  contain at least 2 domain segments (the domain name and TLD). Defaults to
  `true`. Changing to `false` means that `foo@bar` would be allowed.
- `allowDomainLiteral`: Whether or not to allow email addresses with domain
  literals. Defaults to `false`. Changing to `true` means that
  `foo@[123.456.789.0]` would be allowed.

## Decision

Arcjet provides a single `protect` function that is used to execute your
protection rules. This requires a `request` argument which is the request
context as passed to the request handler. When configured with a `validateEmail`
rule it also requires an additional `email` prop.

<GuardDecision />

This function returns a `Promise` that resolves to an
`ArcjetDecision` object. This contains the following properties:

- `id` (`string`) - The unique ID for the request. This can be used to look up
  the request in the Arcjet dashboard. It is prefixed with `req_` for decisions
  involving the Arcjet cloud API. For decisions taken locally, the prefix is
  `lreq_`.
- `conclusion` (`ArcjetConclusion`) - The final conclusion based on evaluating
  each of the configured rules. If you wish to accept Arcjet's recommended
  action based on the configured rules then you can use this property.
- `reason` (`ArcjetReason`) - An object containing more detailed
  information about the conclusion.
- `results` (`ArcjetRuleResult[]`) - An array of `ArcjetRuleResult` objects
  containing the results of each rule that was executed.
- `ip` (`ArcjetIpDetails`) - An object containing Arcjet's analysis of the
  client IP address. See the SDK reference for more information.

You check if a deny conclusion has been returned by an email validation rule by
using `decision.isDenied()` and `decision.reason.isEmail()`.

You can iterate through the results and check whether an email validation rule
was applied:

```ts
for (const result of decision.results) {
  console.log("Rule Result", result);
}
```

This example will log the full result as well as the email validation rule:

<DecisionLogDeny />

## Allowing specific email types

In addition to being able to deny specific email types, you can also configure
Arcjet to only allow specific email types and all other types will be blocked.

<DecisionLogAllow />

## Checking the email type

Arcjet will return the type of email address that was verified. This will be one
or several of the reported email types.

```ts
type ArcjetEmailType =
  | "DISPOSABLE" // Disposable email address from a throwaway email service
  | "FREE" // Email address from a free email service
  | "NO_MX_RECORDS" // Email address with no MX records i.e. is undeliverable
  | "NO_GRAVATAR" // Email address with no Gravatar profile
  | "INVALID"; // Email address that is invalid
```

You can check the email type using the `decision.reason.emailTypes` array:

```ts
let message = "";
// You could return specific messages based on the email type, but this would
// also reveal the validation to a spammer
if (decision.reason.emailTypes.includes("DISPOSABLE")) {
  message = "We do not allow disposable email addresses.";
} else if (decision.reason.emailTypes.includes("FREE")) {
  message =
    "We do not allow free email addresses, please use a business address.";
} else if (decision.reason.emailTypes.includes("NO_MX_RECORDS")) {
  message = "Your email domain does not have an MX record. Is there a typo?";
} else if (decision.reason.emailTypes.includes("NO_GRAVATAR")) {
  message = "We require a Gravatar profile to sign up.";
} else {
  // This is a catch all
  message = "Invalid email.";
}
```

## Error handling

Arcjet is designed to fail open so that a service issue or misconfiguration does
not block all requests. The SDK will also time out and fail open after 1000ms in
development (see [`ARCJET_ENV`](/environment#arcjet-env)) and 500ms
otherwise.
However, in most cases, the response time will be less than 20-30ms.

If there is an error condition when processing the rule, Arcjet will return an
`ERROR` result for that rule and you can check the `message` property on the rule's
error result for more information.

If all other rules that were run returned an `ALLOW` result, then the final Arcjet
conclusion will be `ERROR`.

<Errors />

## Testing

Arcjet runs the same in any environment, including locally and in CI. You can
use the `mode` set to `DRY_RUN` to log the results of rule execution without
blocking any requests.

We have an example test framework you can use to automatically test your rules.
Arcjet can also be triggered based using a sample of your traffic.

See the [Testing](/testing) section of the docs for details.
