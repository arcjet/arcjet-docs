import Comments from "/src/components/Comments.astro";

We are delighted to announce that we have made our first beta release of the Arcjet
JavaScript SDK. With this release we have decided to make a number of deprecations.

We have not made any breaking changes with this release, however we recommend following
this migration guide to avoid having to make further breaking changes in the future.

## Block is now deny for the `validateEmail` rule

When configuring the validateEmail rule we have renamed the block option to deny.

```
validateEmail({
  mode: "LIVE",
  // replace block with deny as shown
  // block: ["DISPOSABLE"],
  deny: ["DISPOSABLE"],
})
```

It is now also possible to configure email types to allow. In the below example,
only email addresses from free email providers will be allowed.

```
validateEmail({
  mode: "LIVE",
  allow: ["FREE"],
})
```

## ArcjetEnum objects are now deprecated

In earlier versions of the SDK we provided enum objects for configuring your rules,
however these have been deprecated in favor of string-type enums.

The table below shows which enums you should replace and their equivalent strings.

## Wasm loading has moved to `@arcjet/analyze-wasm`

We have moved the responsibility for loading wasm on your target platform from
`@arcjet/analyze` to `@arcjet/analyze-wasm`. This should not affect users who
were using the SDK through the high level adapters as documented.
