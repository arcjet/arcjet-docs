Arcjet uses several environment variables that influence its behavior.
These are [listed and explained][section-list] in this article.

Arcjet recommends [defining environment variables][section-define] based on the
guidance and best practices of your chosen framework and hosting provider e.g.
use `.env.local` files in development and the secrets management of your hosting
platform in production.

## List of Arcjet environment variables

<a name="arcjet-base-url" />

### `ARCJET_BASE_URL`

Default: `"https://decide.arcjet.com"`

URL to Arcjet Cloud API.
Should only be set if directed by Arcjet support.
See [Architecture: Cloud API][arcjet-architecture-cloud-api] for more info.

Note that when deployed to Fly.io the default is automatically changed to
`"https://fly.decide.arcjet.com"`, which is a dedicated endpoint that runs on on
the Fly platform for lower latency.

{/* TODO: `baseUrl` can also be passed in `RemoteClientOptions` of `createRemoteClient`, in which case there is no verification; document that somewhere and link to it from here. */}

<a name="arcjet-env" />

<a name="node-env" />

### `ARCJET_ENV`, `NODE_ENV`

Whether the app is running in development
(`"development" | "production"`, default: `"production"`).
Arcjet is in development mode if either of these fields is set to `"development"`
and production mode otherwise.
`NODE_ENV` is a convention used in Node.js apps.

In development, the timeout for connecting to Cloud API is increased.
In production, the timeout is quicker.
This is because in production your app typically runs close to an Arcjet server,
but in development your app may run on your local machine, far away from Arcjet
servers.
See [Architecture: API latency][arcjet-architecture-api-latency] for more info.

In production, an error is logged when no client IP is found.
In development, the local IP `127.0.0.1` is used as a fallback.
When the client IP is missing (or local),
geolocation and other IP lookup info will be empty.
In development, an `x-arcjet-ip` header can be used to overwrite the client IP.
This is because it’s useful to overwrite IPs for testing,
but in production headers cannot be trusted as they can be set by malicious
users.

{/* TODO: link to Client IP concept when that lands. */}

The Arcjet Astro SDK uses `ARCJET_ENV` and the value at `import.meta.env.MODE`
(from Vite) but does not use `NODE_ENV`.

<a name="arcjet-key" />

### `ARCJET_KEY`

Arcjet key for your site (`string`).
In most cases, this variable name is a recommended convention.
This value is not read automatically, unlike other variables, but should be
retrieved manually from the environment and must be passed explicitly to
Arcjet SDKs.
See [“How to read environment variables”][section-read] for more info.

You can find your site key in the [Arcjet dashboard][arcjet-app].
Select your site, select “SDK configuration”, then click to copy.

Arcjet keys are secrets that are always prefixed with `ajkey_`.
As this is a secret, do not commit it to source control or otherwise expose it!

This value is read automatically when using the Arcjet Astro SDK.

<a name="arcjet-log-level" />

### `ARCJET_LOG_LEVEL`

Log level to use (`"debug" | "error" | "info" | "warn"`, default: `"warn"`).
Setting for example `warn` will log warning _and_ error messages.
The order of log levels from most verbose to least verbose is `debug`, `info`,
`warn`, `error`.

<a name="firebase-config" />

<a name="fly-app-name" />

<a name="render" />

<a name="vercel" />

## List of environment variables read by Arcjet

### `FIREBASE_CONFIG`, `FLY_APP_NAME`, `RENDER`, `VERCEL`

Environment variables set by hosting platforms (`string`).
These should not be set in `.env` files but are set automatically by the
platforms where your app runs.
Arcjet checks whether values are non-empty.

[`FIREBASE_CONFIG`][google-firebase-config] is set by Firebase,
[`FLY_APP_NAME`][fly-app-name] is set by Fly,
[`RENDER`][render-render] is set by Render, and
[`VERCEL`][vercel-vercel] is set by Vercel.

The inferred platform affects which request headers are trusted when determining the
client IP.
When Fly is detected, that affects the default value of `ARCJET_BASE_URL`.

{/* TODO: link to Client IP concept when that lands. */}

<a name="vercel-git-commit-sha" />

### `VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_SHA`

Git SHA of the commit the deployment was triggered by (`string`).
This should not be set in `.env` files but
[`VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_SHA`][vercel-git-commit-sha] is automatically
set by Vercel.
When present in the Arcjet Next.js SDK,
its value is sent to Arcjet Cloud API as part of the `extra` fields,
which are displayed in the [Arcjet dashboard][arcjet-app].

## How to define environment variables

Arcjet recommends using `.env.local` files in development to set environment
variables. Be sure to avoid committing any `.env` files that contain secrets to
source control.

In production it is recommended to set environment variables using the dashboard
provided by the platform where your app runs, and not to use `.env` files.

Node 20+ supports loading environment variables from a local file with
`--env-file`. If you're using an older version of Node, you can use a package
like [`dotenv`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) to load the environment
variables from a `.env.local` file.

```sh
node --env-file .env.local index.js
```

### How to load `.env` files

Whether `.env` files are loaded automatically and how to load them manually
depends on the framework and runtime.

In [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/environment-variables/),
[Bun](https://bun.com/docs/runtime/environment-variables),
[Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/docs/4.x/guide/going-further/runtime-config#environment-variables),
[Remix](https://v2.remix.run/docs/guides/envvars) (in development), and
[SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapter-node#Environment-variables)
(with `adapter-node`, in development),
`.env` files are loaded automatically.

In [Deno](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/reference/env_variables/),
you can load `.env` files by running with the `--env-file` flag.

In [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/environment_variables.html)
(which includes Fastify, NestJS, and React Router),
you can load a specific `.env` file by running with the `--env-file=file` flag.

In [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/guides/environment-variables),
`.env` files are loaded automatically when using `loadEnvConfig` from
`@next/env`.

## How to read environment variables

Arcjet reads most environment variables automatically.
The `ARCJET_KEY` value is not read automatically, except in Astro.
How to read it and other environment variables depends on your framework or
runtime:

In [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/process.html#processenv)
and [Bun](https://bun.com/docs/runtime/environment-variables#reading-environment-variables),
you can read environment variables from `process.env`.

In [Deno](https://docs.deno.com/api/deno/~/Deno.Env.get),
you can read environment variables with `Deno.env.get()`.

In SvelteKit you can read environment variables from
[`$env/dynamic/private`](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/$env-dynamic-private) and
the like.
