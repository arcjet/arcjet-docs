Unlike network-based security solutions, Arcjet can run locally, in staging and
in production. This makes it easy to test your security rules before deploying
them.

You can also automate testing against your Arcjet-projected routes using
standard testing libraries.

## Testing using Newman

[Newman](https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman) is an open source command-line
collection runner for [Postman](https://www.postman.com/). It allows you to
define requests in Postman format and run them from the command line without
requiring Postman itself.

You can find our full example of how to test Arcjet with Express and Newman [on
GitHub](https://github.com/arcjet/arcjet-js/tree/main/examples/express-newman).
The key files are:

- [`index.js`](https://github.com/arcjet/arcjet-js/blob/main/examples/express-newman/index.js)
  is a simple Express server that uses Arcjet to protect several routes. This is
  the application being tested.
- [`tests/api.test.js`](https://github.com/arcjet/arcjet-js/blob/main/examples/express-newman/tests/api.test.js)
  is the test runner which loads the test definitions, executes them with
  Newman, and then asserts the expected results.
- The
  [`tests/bots.json`](https://github.com/arcjet/arcjet-js/blob/main/examples/express-newman/tests/bots.json),
  [`tests/high-rate-limit.json`](https://github.com/arcjet/arcjet-js/blob/main/examples/express-newman/tests/high-rate-limit.json),
  and
  [`tests/low-rate-limit.json`](https://github.com/arcjet/arcjet-js/blob/main/examples/express-newman/tests/low-rate-limit.json)
  files define the test requests in [Postman Collection
  format](https://learning.postman.com/collection-format/getting-started/overview/).

The example
[`README`](https://github.com/arcjet/arcjet-js/tree/main/examples/express-newman)
explains how to start the test application and then execute the tests using
Newman.

To adapt these to your own application you would modify the `tests/*.json` files
to point to your application endpoints, and then run them using the Newman CLI.
This allows you to automate testing and run multiple iterations e.g. to test a
rate limit.

## Testing triggering rules

Arcjet runs the same in production as locally. This ensures that the behavior
you see in development is the same as in production. However, there are ways to
trigger the different rules.

- **Shield:** Send 5 requests with the special header `x-arcjet-suspicious:
true` to trigger the shield rule on the next request.
- **Rate limiting:** Make more requests than the rate limit allows.
- **Bot protection:** Bot detection uses multiple heuristics so the quickest way
  to get a bot detection `DENY` response is to make a request that is always
  considered a bot. With a deny rule set to `CURL` you should see a `DENY`
  response if you make a request using the `curl` command. See [Identifying
  Bots](/bot-protection/identifying-bots) for more information.
- **Email validation:** Use an email address that has invalid syntax or does not
  match any other rules you have configured e.g. has no MX records or if from a
  disposable email service.

## Sampling

Arcjet is designed to run on every request. When testing your rules, you can use
`DRY_RUN` mode to see how your rules would behave without actually enforcing
them. The result will be logged, but all requests will be allowed. This is useful
for testing your rules without affecting your users.

You can also write a simple sampling function to set the Arcjet rules using
`withRule` based on a desired sample rate. This allows you to test your rules on
a subset of your traffic.

This Next.js middleware example shows how to trigger Arcjet Shield and bot
detection rules in live mode on 10% of your traffic.
