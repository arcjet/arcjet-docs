description: "Block malicious traffic with Arcjet filters."

You may be looking at your logs and seeing malicious traffic coming through.
Perhaps you can identify a bot or other automated tool by its `user-agent` or
IP range.

We appreciate hearing about such traffic from you!
We are constantly improving how Arcjet works but security is an ever-evolving
field and there are [known limitations][arcjet-limitations] to different
approaches.
Please reach out to [Arcjet support][arcjet-support] to share what you are
seeing.

In the meantime you can use [Arcjet filters][arcjet-filters] to block unwanted
traffic.
This blueprint covers two example use cases to show how that can be done:

- [Block a custom bot](#block-a-custom-bot)
  — an expression to block a specific `user-agent` or IP
- [Block a dynamic list of IPs](#block-a-dynamic-list-of-ips)
  — a generated expression to block a list of IPs

## Block a custom bot

You could be using [Arcjet bot protection][arcjet-bots] already and still may
need to block a particular bot or similar tool that is not in
[our list at `arcjet/well-known-bots`][github-arcjet-well-known-bots].
(PRs welcome!)
That could be because the bot is very new,
not widely used,
or that it is something custom and different.
Such bots are often detected by their `user-agent` header,
an IP,
or a combination of both (sometimes `and`, sometimes `or`).

Let’s take Bytespider
(by ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok)
as an example,
even though it is already on our list.
Searching the internet shows that it has different values for `user-agent`
(sometimes `Bytespider`, sometimes `TikTokSpider`)
and also uses different IPs
(the CIDR range `47.128.0.0/16` seems to match).

With [Arcjet filters][arcjet-filters]
you can write an expression to block traffic matching that user agent _or_
that IP range:

```ts
characteristics: ['http.request.headers["user-agent"]', "ip.src"],
rules: [
  filter({
    deny: [
     'http.request.headers["user-agent"] matches "Bytespider|TikTokSpider" or ip.src in { 47.128.0.0/16 }',
    ],
    mode: "LIVE"
  }),
  // …
]
```

…but it is important to note that bots change,
so it is good to check and update your rules once in a while.

## Block a dynamic list of IPs

Sometimes you may want to block a list of IPs that changes over time
and you know where to find that latest list.
In such cases you can generate an expression dynamically.

Such lists of IPs could be on a remote server,
in a database,
or perhaps you maintain a list in a local file.
These lists may also contain other things instead of IPs,
like `user-agent`s,
which would work similarly.

To illustrate,
Cloudflare provides lists of [IP ranges][cloudflare-ips] that they use.
This is a theoretical example to show how it could work and not a
recommendation,
but one can argue that any traffic through Cloudflare is likely to be
automated.
The important caveat is that this may block people using iCloud Relay and
Cloudflare WARP VPN.

With [`fetch`][mdn-fetch] and [Arcjet filters][arcjet-filters]
you can generate an expression dynamically:

```ts
const listsOfIps = await Promise.all(
  [
    "https://www.cloudflare.com/ips-v4/",
    "https://www.cloudflare.com/ips-v6/",
  ].map(async function (url) {
    const response = await fetch(url);
    const body = await response.text();
    return body.trim().split("\n");
  }),
);

const arcjet = arcjetFastify({
  characteristics: ["ip.src"],
  key: process.env.ARCJET_KEY!,
  rules: [
    filter({
      deny: ["ip.src in { " + listsOfIps.flat().join(" ") + " }"],
      mode: "LIVE",
    }),
    // …
  ],
});
// …
```

This example fetches when the server starts.
That is probably more than needed for Cloudflare as these lists change about
once per year.
An exercise for the reader is to move this into a script that runs periodically
and writes to a file,
then loading that file when starting the server.
