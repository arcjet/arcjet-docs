import { Code } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import CustomValidationRule from "@/snippets/blueprints/CustomValidationRule.ts?raw";

The Arcjet SDK can be augmented with custom rules written by users, as long as
they match the format defined by our [`@arcjet/protocol`
package](https://github.com/arcjet/arcjet-js/tree/main/protocol). These rules
will only be run locally since the Arcjet service doesn't know about them;
however, they can still be useful for some use cases.

The structure of a local rule is:

```ts
interface ArcjetLocalRule<Props extends { [key: string]: unknown } = {}> {
  type: string;
  mode: "LIVE" | "DRY_RUN";
  priority: number;
  validate(
    context: ArcjetContext,
    details: Partial<ArcjetRequestDetails & Props>,
  ): asserts details is ArcjetRequestDetails & Props;
  protect(
    context: ArcjetContext,
    details: ArcjetRequestDetails & Props,
  ): Promise<ArcjetRuleResult>;
}
```

For example, you may want to [validate form
input](https://blog.arcjet.com/next-js-security-checklist/#2-data-validation-and-sanitization)
as part of your Arcjet protections before a request reaches your route handler,
such as via Next.js middleware.

## Local rule: Zod + Body validation

If we want to run [Zod](https://zod.dev/) schema validation against the request
body, we need to create a new local rule:

<Code code={CustomValidationRule} lang="ts" />

As long as it conforms to the local rule interface, this rule can be consumed by
the Arcjet SDK like any other rule!

```ts
const aj = arcjet({
  key: process.env.ARCJET_KEY!,
  rules: [
    validateBody({
      mode: "LIVE",
      schema: z.object({
        email: z.string(),
      }),
    }),
  ],
});
```

When `aj.protect()` is called, inside middleware or directly inside a route,
this custom local rule will be executed and deny the request if the body doesn't
pass validation.
