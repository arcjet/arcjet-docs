import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Every decision provided by Arcjet includes IP address analysis. You can use this
to detect VPNs and proxies.

## Available fields

- **IP AS type.** This is the [Autonomous
  System](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_(Internet)>) associated
  with the IP, which can be used to identify VPNs and proxies. This can be one
  of `isp`, `hosting`, `business` or `education`.
- **IP type.** Arcjet adds one or more categories to the IP address to help you
  identify VPNs and proxies. The categories are `vpn`, `proxy`, `tor`,
  `hosting`, `relay`.

## Checking for data

The IP analysis fields may be `undefined`, but you can use various methods to
check their availability. See the SDK reference for details.

## Example

```ts
// ... imports, client configuration, etc
// See https://docs.arcjet.com/get-started
const decision = await aj.protect(req);

if (decision.ip.hasASN() && decision.ip.asnType === "hosting") {
  // The network this IP belongs to is a hosting provider, which makes it more
  // likely to be a VPN, proxy, or other suspicious network.
}

if (
  decision.ip.isHosting() ||
  decision.ip.isVpn() ||
  decision.ip.isProxy() ||
  decision.ip.isRelay()
) {
  // The IP is from a hosting provider, VPN, or proxy. We can check the name
  // of the service and customize the response
  if (decision.ip.hasService()) {
    if (decision.ip.service === "Apple Private Relay") {
      // We trust Apple Private Relay because it requires an active iCloud
      // subscription, so we can allow it
    } else {
      // Do something else
    }
  } else {
    // The service name is not available, but we can still do something here
  }
}
```
