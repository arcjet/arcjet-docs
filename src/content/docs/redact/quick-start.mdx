The Arcjet Redaction library makes it easy to redact sensitive information
locally. It is a utility library independent of the main Arcjet SDK so can be
used with or without other Arcjet rules.

## SDK installation

Follow these steps to get started:

### 1. Install Arcjet Redact

In your project root, run the following command to install the Arcjet redact
library:

```bash
npm i @arcjet/redact
```

### 2. Redact some text

Now all you have to do to Redact text is to call the `redact` function. It can
be configured to redact a number of built-in entity types, or else you can
provide a custom detect function to redact your own types. The types that we support
by default are: `email`, `phone-number`, `ip-address`, `credit-card`.

<Code code={QuickStartRedact} lang="ts" />

### 3. Unredact a response

If you want to un-redact some text that contains the replacements from the redact
function just call `unredact`, it is passed as the value in the return array.

<Code code={QuickStartUnredact} lang="ts" />
