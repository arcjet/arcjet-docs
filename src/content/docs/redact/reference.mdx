The Arcjet Redaction library makes it easy to redact sensitive information
locally. It is a utility library independent of the main Arcjet SDK so can be
used with or without other Arcjet rules.

## Configuration

The configuration definition is:

```ts
type RedactOptions = {
  entities?: Array<SensitiveInfoType>;
  contextWindowSize?: number;
  detect?: (tokens: string[]) -> Array<SensitiveInfoType | undefined>;
  replace?: (detectedEntity: SensitiveInfoType) -> string | undefined;
};
```

- `entities`: The list of entities that you wish to redact. If undefined then all
  entities are redacted. Valid values are: `email`, `phone-number`,
  `ip-address`, '`credit-card`, or any string returned from `detect`.
- `contextWindowSize` - How many tokens to pass to the `detect` function at a
  time. Setting this to a higher value allows for more context to be used when
  determing if a token is sensitive or not. For best performance this should be
  set to as low a number as possible to provide the context that you need.
- `detect` - An optional function that allows you to detect custom entities. It
  will be passed a list of tokens as big as `contextWindowSize` and should
  return a list of detected entities of the same length.
- `replace` - An optional function that allows you to define your own
  replacements for detected entities. It is passed a string with the type of
  entity detected and it should either return a replacement for that entity type
  or `undefined`.

## Redacting and Unredacting

The Arcjet Redaction library can be used to both redact and unredact text. First
you redact using the `redact()` function which returns both the redacted text
and an `unredact()` function as a tuple. You can use the `unredact()` function
later on to replace redacted entities with their originals.

<Code code={QuickStartUnredact} lang="ts" />

## Custom entity detection

When configuring a redaction you can provide a custom entity detect function,
this enables you to detect entities that we don't support out of the box using
custom logic.

The function will take a list of tokens and must return a list of either
`undefined`, if the corresponding token in the input list is not sensitive, or
the name of the entity if it does match. The number of tokens that are provided
to the function is controlled by the `contextWindowSize` option, which defaults
to 1. If you need additional context to perform detections then you can increase
this value.

In cases of a conflict the first identified entity type is used.

<Code code={CustomEntities} lang="ts" />

## Custom entity redaction

You can provide a function to perform custom entity redaction if have different
requirements for the redacted entities. A common example of this is to use a
library such as [faker.js](https://fakerjs.dev/) to generate redacted entities
that look exactly like the real ones.

:::note
If you are using `unredact()` it is important that each redacted entity is unique. If many
pieces of sensitive info are replaced by the same string then unredaction won't work correctly.
