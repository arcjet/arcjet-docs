Arcjet filters let you block requests using
[Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/)-like [display
filter](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/ChWorkBuildDisplayFilterSection.html)
expressions over HTTP headers, IP addresses, and other request fields. This
allows you to quickly enforce rules like allow/deny by country, network, or
`user-agent`.

## Plan availability

Arcjet filter rules is available on all [pricing
plans](https://arcjet.com/pricing).

    "node-js-express",
    "node-js-hono",
    "react-router",
  ]}
  client:load
/>

## Configuration

Allow or deny filters are configured using one or more expressions:

- `allow` - A list of expressions that will result in an `ALLOW` decision if the
  request matches. If none of the expressions match, the request will be denied.
- `deny` - A list of expressions that will result in a `DENY` decision if the
  request matches. If none of the expressions match, the request will be
  allowed.
- These lists are mutually-exclusive, so you can only use one or the other.

They are constructed with the `filters(options)` function and configured by
`FilterOptionsAllow` or `FilterOptionsDeny`:

<DisplayType from="arcjet" type="FilterOptions" />
<DisplayType from="arcjet" type="ArcjetMode" />

:::note
When specifying multiple rules, the order of the rules is ignored. Rule
execution ordering is automatically optimized for performance.
See [decision](#decision) below for details of examining the execution results.
:::

### Example: Allow non-VPN, US-based GET requests

In this example, the expression matches non-VPN GET requests from the US.
Requests matching the expression are allowed and all others are denied.

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <BunAllow slot="bun" />
  <DenoAllow slot="deno" />
  <NestJsAllow slot="nest-js" />
  <NextJsAllow slot="next-js" />
  <NodeJsAllow slot="node-js" />
  <RemixAllow slot="remix" />
  <SvelteKitAllow slot="sveltekit" />
</SlotByFramework>

## Expression language

The expression language is based on [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/)-like
[display
filter](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/ChWorkBuildDisplayFilterSection.html)
expressions. Like other programming languages, there are fields (`ip.src.vpn`),
functions (`lower()`), operators (`or`, `matches`), and values (`"curl"`).

### Example: Matching VPN, Tor, or Curl requests

This example matches VPN or Tor traffic and basic Curl requests.

```text
ip.src.vpn or
ip.src.tor or
lower(http.request.headers["user-agent"]) matches "curl"
```

To use it as a filter deny rule so that any requests matching the expression are
denied (and all others allowed), you would configure Arcjet like this:

```ts
filter({
  deny: [
    'ip.src.vpn or ip.src.tor or lower(http.request.headers["user-agent"]) matches "curl"',
  ],
  mode: "LIVE",
}),
```

You can also split the expressions within the array for readability. They will
be combined as an `OR` operation:

```ts
filter({
  deny: [
    // Expressions will be combined with OR
    'ip.src.vpn',
    'ip.src.tor',
    'lower(http.request.headers["user-agent"]) matches "curl"',
  ],
  mode: "LIVE",
}),
```

To combine multiple conditions e.g. with `and`, use a single expression string.

### Example: Matching requests from specific countries

This example matches requests from the European Union:

```text
ip.src.country in {"AT" "BE" "BG" "CY" "CZ" "DE" "DK" "EE" "ES" "FI" "FR" "GR" "HR" "HU" "IE" "IT" "LT" "LU" "LV" "MT" "NL" "PL" "PT" "RO" "SE" "SI" "SK"}
```

To use it as a filter allow rule so that only requests matching the expression
are allowed (and all others denied), you would configure Arcjet like this:

```ts
filter({
  allow: [
    'ip.src.country in {"AT" "BE" "BG" "CY" "CZ" "DE" "DK" "EE" "ES" "FI" "FR" "GR" "HR" "HU" "IE" "IT" "LT" "LU" "LV" "MT" "NL" "PL" "PT" "RO" "SE" "SI" "SK"}',
  ],
  mode: "LIVE",
}),
```

All `ip.src.*` fields reflect information about the client IP address (the
request source IP). These fields require data from our IP reputation database so
a call to the Arcjet API is required. Other fields are analyzed locally.

Arcjet only ever makes a single call to our Cloud API regardless of the rule
configuration. The Arcjet API has been designed for high performance and low
latency, and is deployed to multiple regions around the world. The SDK will
automatically use the closest region which means the total overhead is typically
no more than 20-30ms, often significantly less. See the [Architecture
reference](/architecture#arcjet-cloud-api) for details.

## Functions

| Function | Example                                                       |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `len`    | `len(http.request.uri.args["q"]) gt 0`                        |
| `lower`  | `lower(ip.src.country) contains "be"`                         |
| `upper`  | `upper(http.request.headers["user-agent"]) contains "CHROME"` |

## Values

### Strings

String values are enclosed in double quotes (`"`).

Double quotes within the string must be escaped with a backslash (`\"`).

```text
http.host eq "example.com"
```

### Booleans

Boolean values are either `true` or `false`.
You can negate a boolean value with the `not` (`!`) operator.

```text
ip.src.vpn
```

```text
not ip.src.vpn
```

### IP addresses

IP addresses are a special type which must not be quoted like strings.

```text
ip.src eq 185.199.108.153
```

```text
ip.src in { 185.199.108.153 185.199.109.153 185.199.110.153 185.199.111.153 }
```

```text
ip.src in { 192.0.2.0/24 }
```

### Maps

Maps (or associative arrays) are a collection of keys to values.

They cannot be written literally in the expression language, but they exist for
the fields `http.request.cookie`, `http.request.headers`, and
`http.request.uri.args`.

```text
http.request.headers["user-agent"] matches "Chrome"
```

## Decision

Arcjet provides a single `protect` function that is used to execute your
protection rules.

This function returns a `Promise` that resolves to an `ArcjetDecision` object.
This contains the following properties:

- `id` (`string`) - The unique ID for the request. This can be used to look up
  the request in the Arcjet dashboard. It is prefixed with `req_` for decisions
  involving the Arcjet cloud API. For decisions taken locally, the prefix is
  `lreq_`.
- `conclusion` (`ArcjetConclusion`) - The final conclusion based on evaluating
  each of the configured rules. If you wish to accept Arcjet's recommended
  action based on the configured rules then you can use this property.
- `reason` (`ArcjetReason`) - An object containing more detailed
  information about the conclusion.
- `results` (`ArcjetRuleResult[]`) - An array of `ArcjetRuleResult` objects
  containing the results of each rule that was executed.
- `ip` (`ArcjetIpDetails`) - An object containing Arcjet's analysis of the
  client IP address. See the SDK reference for more information.

You check if a deny conclusion has been returned by a filter rule by using
`decision.isDenied()` and `decision.reason.isFilterRule()` respectively.

You can iterate through the results and check whether a filter rule was applied:

```ts
for (const result of decision.results) {
  console.log("Rule Result", result);
}
```

## Error handling

Arcjet is designed to fail open so that a service issue or misconfiguration does
not block all requests. The SDK will also time out and fail open after 500ms
when `NODE_ENV` is `production` and 1000ms otherwise. However, in most cases,
the response time will be less than 20-30ms.

If there is an error condition when processing the rule, Arcjet will return an
`ERROR` result for that rule and you can check the `message` property on the rule's
error result for more information.

If all other rules that were run returned an `ALLOW` result, then the final Arcjet
conclusion will be `ERROR`.

## Testing

Arcjet runs the same in any environment, including locally and in CI. You can
use the `mode` set to `DRY_RUN` to log the results of rule execution without
blocking any requests.

We have an example test framework you can use to automatically test your rules.
Arcjet can also be triggered based using a sample of your traffic.

See the [Testing](/testing) section of the docs for details.

## Limitations

- A maximum of 10 expressions can be specified.
- Each expression can be a maximum of 1024 bytes.
