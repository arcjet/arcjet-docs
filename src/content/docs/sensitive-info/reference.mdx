Arcjet Sensitive Information Detection protects against clients sending you
sensitive information such as PII that you do not wish to handle.

<FrameworkLinks
  client:load
  exclude={frameworks
    .filter((d) => !frontmatter.frameworks.includes(d.key))
    .map((d) => d.key)}
  title="Choose a framework"
/>

## Configuration

Sensitive information detection is configured by allowing or denying a subset of
sensitive information. The `allow` and `deny` lists are mutually-exclusive, such
that using `allow` will result in a `DENY` decision for any detected sensitive
information that is not specified in the `allow` list and using `deny` will
result in an `ALLOW` decision for any detected sensitive information that is not
specified in the `deny` list.

The `arcjet` client can be configured with one or more Sensitive information
rules, which are constructed with the
`sensitiveInfo(options: SensitiveInfoOptionsAllow | SensitiveInfoOptionsDeny)`
function and configured by `SensitiveInfoOptionsAllow` or
`SensitiveInfoOptionsDeny`:

```ts
type SensitiveInfoOptionsAllow = {
  mode?: "LIVE" | "DRY_RUN";
  allow?: Array<ArcjetSensitiveInfoType>;
  contextWindowSize?: number;
  // You can also provide a custom detection function to detect other types
  // of sensitive information (see below).
  detect?: (tokens: string[]) -> Array<SensitiveInfoType | undefined>;
};
```

```ts
type SensitiveInfoOptionsDeny = {
  mode?: "LIVE" | "DRY_RUN";
  deny?: Array<ArcjetSensitiveInfoType>;
  contextWindowSize?: number;
  // You can also provide a custom detection function to detect other types
  // of sensitive information (see below).
  detect?: (tokens: string[]) -> Array<SensitiveInfoType | undefined>;
};
```

<DisplayType type="ArcjetSensitiveInfoType" from="arcjet" />

:::note
When specifying multiple rules, the order of the rules is ignored. Rule
execution ordering is automatically optimized for performance. See
[decision](#decision) below for details of examining the execution results.

</SlotByFramework>

## Decision

Arcjet provides a single `protect` function that is used to execute your
protection rules.

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <NestJsGuardDecision slot="nest-js" />
</SlotByFramework>

This function returns a `Promise` that resolves to an
`ArcjetDecision` object. This contains the following properties:

- `id` (`string`) - The unique ID for the request. This can be used to look up
  the request in the Arcjet dashboard. It is prefixed with `req_` for decisions
  involving the Arcjet cloud API. For decisions taken locally, the prefix is
  `lreq_`.
- `conclusion` (`ArcjetConclusion`) - The final conclusion based on evaluating
  each of the configured rules. If you wish to accept Arcjet's recommended
  action based on the configured rules then you can use this property.
- `reason` (`ArcjetReason`) - An object containing more detailed
  information about the conclusion.
- `results` (`ArcjetRuleResult[]`) - An array of `ArcjetRuleResult` objects
  containing the results of each rule that was executed.
- `ip` (`ArcjetIpDetails`) - An object containing Arcjet's analysis of the
  client IP address. See the SDK reference for more information.

You check if a deny conclusion has been returned by a sensitive info rule by using
`decision.isDenied()` and `decision.reason.isSensitiveInfo()` respectively.

You can iterate through the results and check whether a sensitive info rule was applied:

```ts
for (const result of decision.results) {
  console.log("Rule Result", result);
}
```

This example will log the full result as well as the sensitive info rule:

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <DecisionLogBun slot="bun" />
  <DecisionLogNestJs slot="nest-js" />
  <DecisionLogNextJs slot="next-js" />
  <DecisionLogNodeJs slot="node-js" />
  <DecisionLogRemix slot="remix" />
  <DecisionLogSvelteKit slot="sveltekit" />
</SlotByFramework>

## Entity detection

Different kinds of sensitive info are detected by Arcjet itself.
Next to these,
it is also possible to detect custom kinds through a `detect` function.
Custom detect functions can also be used if your needs are more strict or
instead more loose than the defaults.

### Card numbers

Card numbers can be detected.
The values `4242424242424242`, `4000 0566 5566 5556`, and `3782-8224-6310005`
match but `4242424242424241` does not.
Whether something looks like a card number is based on its initial and final
digits.
The initial digits determine the expected length (min, max) of the total
number.
The final digit is a [Luhn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm)
check digit.
Spaces and dashes are ignored because users often group digits.

### Email addresses

Email addresses can be detected.
The values `alice@example.com` and `bob.smith@subdomain.example.com` match but
`alice.example.com` does not.
A dotless domain (`user@localhost`) and a domain literal (`user@[127.0.0.1]`,
if it contains a valid IP) also match.

### IP addresses

IP addresses can be detected.
The values `127.0.0.1` and `::1` match but `012.004.002.000` does not.
IP v4 and v6 addresses are supported.
Whether something looks like an IP address is based on whether it parses
as [`IpAddr` from `std::net`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/net/enum.IpAddr.html).

### Phone numbers

Phone numbers can be detected.
The values `+1 (555) 555-5555` and `(020) 334 4522` match but `555-1234` does not.
As phone numbers have a wide variety of sizes and formats,
special short numbers such as `911` or `14 020` are not detected.
Several characters such as dots (`.`), dashes (`-`), and spaces are allowed
to separate digit groups.
The country code can be prefixed with plus (`+`) or omitted,
the next region group can be in parentheses.

## Custom entity detection

When configuring Arcjet Sensitive Info you can provide a custom detect function,
this enables you to detect entities that we don't support out of the box using
custom logic.

The function will take a list of tokens and must return a list of either
`undefined`, if the corresponding token in the input list is not sensitive, or
the name of the entity if it does match. The number of tokens that are provided
to the function is controlled by the `contextWindowSize` option, which defaults
to 1. If you need additional context to perform detections then you can increase
this value.

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <CustomDetectBun slot="bun" />
  <CustomDetectNestJs slot="nest-js" />
  <CustomDetectNextJs slot="next-js" />
  <CustomDetectNodeJs slot="node-js" />
  <CustomDetectRemix slot="remix" />
  <CustomDetectSvelteKit slot="sveltekit" />
</SlotByFramework>

## Error handling

Arcjet is designed to fail open so that a service issue or misconfiguration does
not block all requests. The SDK will also time out and fail open after 500ms
when `NODE_ENV` is `production` and 1000ms otherwise. However, in most cases,
the response time will be less than 20-30ms.

If there is an error condition when processing the rule, Arcjet will return an
`ERROR` result for that rule and you can check the `message` property on the rule's
error result for more information.

If all other rules that were run returned an `ALLOW` result, then the final Arcjet
conclusion will be `ERROR`.

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <ErrorsBun slot="bun" />
  <ErrorsNestJs slot="nest-js" />
  <ErrorsNextJs slot="next-js" />
  <ErrorsNodeJs slot="node-js" />
  <ErrorsRemix slot="remix" />
  <ErrorsSvelteKit slot="sveltekit" />
</SlotByFramework>

## Testing

Arcjet runs the same in any environment, including locally and in CI. You can
use the `mode` set to `DRY_RUN` to log the results of rule execution without
blocking any requests.

We have an example test framework you can use to automatically test your rules.
Arcjet can also be triggered based using a sample of your traffic.

See the [Testing](/testing) section of the docs for details.
