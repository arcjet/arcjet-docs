Arcjet Sensitive Information Detection protects against clients sending you
sensitive information such as PII that you do not wish to handle.

## Plan availability

Arcjet sensitive information detection availability depends depends on your
[pricing plan](https://arcjet.com/pricing).

| Plan                                      | Sensitive information detection |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| <Badge text="Free" variant="caution" />   | No                              |
| <Badge text="Pro" variant="note" />       | Yes                             |
| <Badge text="Enterprise" variant="tip" /> | Custom                          |

## Configuration

Sensitive information detection is configured by allowing or denying a subset of
sensitive information. The `allow` and `deny` lists are mutually-exclusive, such
that using `allow` will result in a `DENY` decision for any detected sensitive
information that is not specified in the `allow` list and using `deny` will
result in an `ALLOW` decision for any detected sensitive information that is not
specified in the `deny` list.

The `arcjet` client can be configured with one or more Sensitive information
rules, which are constructed with the
`sensitiveInfo(options: SensitiveInfoOptionsAllow | SensitiveInfoOptionsDeny)`
function and configured by `SensitiveInfoOptionsAllow` or
`SensitiveInfoOptionsDeny`:

```ts
type SensitiveInfoOptionsAllow = {
  mode?: "LIVE" | "DRY_RUN";
  allow?: Array<ArcjetSensitiveInfoType>;
  contextWindowSize?: number;
  // You can also provide a custom detection function to detect other types
  // of sensitive information (see below).
  detect?: (tokens: string[]) -> Array<SensitiveInfoType | undefined>;
};
```

```ts
type SensitiveInfoOptionsDeny = {
  mode?: "LIVE" | "DRY_RUN";
  deny?: Array<ArcjetSensitiveInfoType>;
  contextWindowSize?: number;
  // You can also provide a custom detection function to detect other types
  // of sensitive information (see below).
  detect?: (tokens: string[]) -> Array<SensitiveInfoType | undefined>;
};
```

<DisplayType type="ArcjetSensitiveInfoType" from="arcjet" />

:::note
When specifying multiple rules, the order of the rules is ignored. Rule
execution ordering is automatically optimized for performance. See
[decision](#decision) below for details of examining the execution results.
:::

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <NestJsDecoratorRoutes slot="nest-js" />
  <PerRouteVsMiddlewareNextJs slot="next-js" />
  <NextJsPagesServerActions slot="next-js" />
  <PerRouteVsHooksSvelteKit slot="sveltekit" />
</SlotByFramework>

## Decision

Arcjet also provides a single `protect` function that is used to execute your
protection rules.

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <NestJsGuardDecision slot="nest-js" />
</SlotByFramework>

This function returns a `Promise` that resolves to an
`ArcjetDecision` object. This contains the following properties:

- `id` (`string`) - The unique ID for the request. This can be used to look up
  the request in the Arcjet dashboard. It is prefixed with `req_` for decisions
  involving the Arcjet cloud API. For decisions taken locally, the prefix is
  `lreq_`.
- `conclusion` (`ArcjetConclusion`) - The final conclusion based on evaluating
  each of the configured rules. If you wish to accept Arcjet's recommended
  action based on the configured rules then you can use this property.
- `reason` (`ArcjetReason`) - An object containing more detailed
  information about the conclusion.
- `results` (`ArcjetRuleResult[]`) - An array of `ArcjetRuleResult` objects
  containing the results of each rule that was executed.
- `ip` (`ArcjetIpDetails`) - An object containing Arcjet's analysis of the
  client IP address. See the SDK reference for more information.

You check if a deny conclusion has been returned by a sensitive info rule by using
`decision.isDenied()` and `decision.reason.isSensitiveInfo()` respectively.

You can iterate through the results and check whether a sensitive info rule was applied:

```ts
for (const result of decision.results) {
  console.log("Rule Result", result);
}
```

This example will log the full result as well as the sensitive info rule:

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <DecisionLogBun slot="bun" />
  <DecisionLogNestJs slot="nest-js" />
  <DecisionLogNextJs slot="next-js" />
  <DecisionLogNodeJs slot="node-js" />
  <DecisionLogRemix slot="remix" />
  <DecisionLogSvelteKit slot="sveltekit" />
</SlotByFramework>

## Custom entity detection

When configuring Arcjet Sensitive Info you can provide a custom detect function,
this enables you to detect entities that we don't support out of the box using
custom logic.

The function will take a list of tokens and must return a list of either
`undefined`, if the corresponding token in the input list is not sensitive, or
the name of the entity if it does match. The number of tokens that are provided
to the function is controlled by the `contextWindowSize` option, which defaults
to 1. If you need additional context to perform detections then you can increase
this value.

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <CustomDetectBun slot="bun" />
  <CustomDetectNestJs slot="nest-js" />
  <CustomDetectNextJs slot="next-js" />
  <CustomDetectNodeJs slot="node-js" />
  <CustomDetectRemix slot="remix" />
  <CustomDetectSvelteKit slot="sveltekit" />
</SlotByFramework>

## Error handling

Arcjet is designed to fail open so that a service issue or misconfiguration does
not block all requests. The SDK will also time out and fail open after 500ms
when `NODE_ENV` is `production` and 1000ms otherwise. However, in most cases,
the response time will be less than 20-30ms.

If there is an error condition, Arcjet will return an
`ERROR` type and you can check the `reason` property for more information, like
accessing `decision.reason.message`.

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <ErrorsBun slot="bun" />
  <ErrorsNestJs slot="nest-js" />
  <ErrorsNextJs slot="next-js" />
  <ErrorsNodeJs slot="node-js" />
  <ErrorsRemix slot="remix" />
  <ErrorsSvelteKit slot="sveltekit" />
</SlotByFramework>

## Testing

Arcjet runs the same in any environment, including locally and in CI. You can
use the `mode` set to `DRY_RUN` to log the results of rule execution without
blocking any requests.

We have an example test framework you can use to automatically test your rules.
Arcjet can also be triggered based using a sample of your traffic.

See the [Testing](/testing) section of the docs for details.
