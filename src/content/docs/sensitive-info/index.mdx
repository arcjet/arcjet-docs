Arcjet sensitive information detection lets you detect and block sensitive data
in request bodies before it enters your application. Use it to prevent clients
from sending personally identifiable information (PII) and other data you do not
want to handle.

<WhatIsArcjet />

This rule runs entirely locally in your environment, inside the WebAssembly
sandbox shipped with the Arcjet SDK. No request body data ever leaves your
infrastructure.

You can block common types of PII such as email addresses, card numbers, IP
addresses, and phone numbers, as well as custom patterns you define.

Sensitive info works on the request body. To detect specific information in
headers or other request fields, use [Arcjet filters][arcjet-filters].

## When to use Arcjet sensitive info detection

Use sensitive information detection when you want to:

- Reduce your compliance burden by avoiding storage of PII and other regulated
  data.
- Prevent users from pasting card numbers or other sensitive data into generic
  text fields (for example, support forms, feedback forms, or chat boxes).
- Enforce rules that certain endpoints must not receive PII at all.
- Prevent sensitive data being sent to third-party integrations, such as support
  ticket systems or LLMs.

For email addresses specifically, you can also use [Arcjet email
validation][arcjet-email-validation] to validate and verify addresses before
creating accounts or sending email.

## How Arcjet sensitive info detection works

Arcjet analyzes the body of each request locally in your application
environment:

1. The request body is split into tokens ("words").
2. Tokens are checked against built-in detectors (for example, card numbers and
   email addresses).
3. Tokens are also evaluated by any user-defined `detect` functions you
   configure.
4. If sensitive information is found, Arcjet returns a decision so your
   application can block, sanitize, or otherwise handle the request.

All of this logic runs locally with a WebAssembly sandbox that runs in-process.
The raw request body is never sent to Arcjet.

### Built-in entities

The built-in entities include:

- **Card numbers** (such as `4242424242424242`)
- **Email addresses** (such as `alice@arcjet.com`)
- **IP addresses** (such as `127.0.0.1`)
- **Phone numbers** (such as `+1 (555) 555-5555`)

You can combine these with your own custom detectors to cover additional data
types specific to your application.

{/* Note: no section on `characteristics`/`fingerprint` needed as this rule is local. */}

### Privacy and reporting

Sensitive info detection runs entirely locally. Arcjet reports only the decision
(for example, whether sensitive data was detected) to your dashboard; the actual
request body content is not sent to the Arcjet Cloud API.

This lets you enforce PII detection and compliance controls while keeping
sensitive data within your own environment.

## Availability

Sensitive info protection is available on paid plans.
