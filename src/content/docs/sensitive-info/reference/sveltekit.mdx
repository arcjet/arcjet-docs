Arcjet Sensitive Information Detection protects against clients sending you
sensitive information such as PII that you do not wish to handle.

## Configuration

Sensitive Info is configured by specifying which mode you want it to run in.

The configuration definition is:

```ts
type SensitiveInfoOptions = {
  mode?: "LIVE" | "DRY_RUN";
  allow?: Array<SensitiveInfoType>; // Cannot be specified if `deny` is present
  deny?: Array<SensitiveInfoType>;// Cannot be specified if `allow` is present
  contextWindowSize?: number;
  detect?: (tokens: string[]) -> Array<SensitiveInfoType | undefined>;
};
```

The `arcjet` client is configured with one or more `sensitiveInfo` rules which take
one or many `SensitiveInfoOptions`.

:::note
When specifying multiple rules, the order of the rules is ignored. Rule
execution ordering is automatically optimized for performance. See
[decision](#decision) below for details of examining the execution results.

### Per route

This configures sensitive info on a single route.

### Hooks

This will run on every request to your SvelteKit app - see
[the SvelteKit Hooks docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/hooks) for details.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="TS">

Create a file called `hooks.server.ts` in your project (inside `src`):

<Code code={Step3TS} lang="ts" title="/src/hooks.server.ts" />

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="JS">

Create a file called `hooks.server.js` in your project (inside `src`):

<Code code={Step3JS} lang="js" title="/src/hooks.server.js" />

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Avoiding double protection with hooks

If you use Arcjet in hooks and individual routes, you need to be careful
that Arcjet is not running multiple times per request. This can be avoided by
excluding the individual routes before running Arcjet in the hook.

For example, if you already have a sensitive info rule defined in the API route
at `/api/arcjet`, you can exclude it from the hook like this:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="TS">
    <Code
      code={FilterRoutesTS}
      lang="ts"
      title="/src/hooks.server.ts"
      mark={[{ range: "22-28" }]}
    />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="JS">
    <Code
      code={FilterRoutesJS}
      lang="js"
      title="/src/hooks.server.js"
      mark={[{ range: "16-22" }]}
    />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Decision

The [quick start example](/sensitive-info/quick-start/sveltekit) will deny requests
that are determined to be suspicious, immediately returning a response to the
client using SvelteKit's server hook.

Arcjet also provides a single `protect` function that is used to execute your
protection rules. This requires a `RequestEvent` property which is the event
context as passed to the request handler.

This function returns a `Promise` that resolves to an
`ArcjetDecision` object. This contains the following properties:

- `id` (`string`) - The unique ID for the request. This can be used to look up
  the request in the Arcjet dashboard. It is prefixed with `req_` for decisions
  involving the Arcjet cloud API. For decisions taken locally, the prefix is
  `lreq_`.
- `conclusion` (`ArcjetConclusion`) - The final conclusion based on evaluating
  each of the configured rules. If you wish to accept Arcjet's recommended
  action based on the configured rules then you can use this property.
- `reason` (`ArcjetReason`) - An object containing more detailed
  information about the conclusion.
- `results` (`ArcjetRuleResult[]`) - An array of `ArcjetRuleResult` objects
  containing the results of each rule that was executed.
- `ip` (`ArcjetIpDetails`) - An object containing Arcjet's analysis of the
  client IP address. See [IP analysis](/reference/sveltekit#ip-analysis) in the
  SDK reference for more information.

See [the SDK reference](/reference/sveltekit#results) for more details about the
rule results.

You check if a deny conclusion has been returned by a sensitive info rule by using
`decision.isDenied()` and `decision.reason.isSensitiveInfo()` respectively.

You can iterate through the results and check whether a sensitive info rule was applied:

```ts
for (const result of decision.results) {
  console.log("Rule Result", result);
}
```

This example will log the full result as well as the sensitive info rule:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="TS">
Create a new API route at `/src/routes/api/arcjet/+server.ts`:

<Code
  code={DecisionLogTS}
  title="/src/routes/api/arcjet/+server.ts"
  lang="ts"
  mark={[{ range: "22-32" }]}
/>

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="JS">
Create a new API route at `/src/routes/api/arcjet/+server.js`:

<Code
  code={DecisionLogJS}
  title="/src/routes/api/arcjet/+server.js"
  lang="js"
  mark={[{ range: "21-31" }]}
/>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Custom entity detection

When configuring Arcjet Sensitive Info you can provide a custom detect function,
this enables you to detect entities that we don't support out of the box using
custom logic.

The function will take a list of tokens and must return a list of either
`undefined`, if the corresponding token in the input list is not sensitive, or
the name of the entity if it does match. The number of tokens that are provided
to the function is controlled by the `contextWindowSize` option, which defaults
to 1. If you need additional context to perform detections then you can increase
this value.

    <Code code={CustomDetectTS} lang="ts" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="JS">
    <Code code={CustomDetectJS} lang="js" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Error handling

Arcjet is designed to fail open so that a service issue or misconfiguration does
not block all requests. The SDK will also time out and fail open after 500ms
when `NODE_ENV` is `production` and 1000ms otherwise. However, in most cases,
the response time will be less than 20-30ms.

If there is an error condition, Arcjet will return an
`ERROR` type and you can check the `reason` property for more information, like
accessing `decision.reason.message`.

<TabItem label="TS">

<Code
  code={ErrorsTS}
  title="/src/routes/api/arcjet/+server.ts"
  lang="ts"
  mark={[{ range: "17-22" }]}
/>

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="JS">

<Code
  code={ErrorsJS}
  title="/src/routes/api/arcjet/+server.js"
  lang="js"
  mark={[{ range: "17-22" }]}
/>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Testing

Arcjet runs the same in any environment, including locally and in CI. You can
use the `mode` set to `DRY_RUN` to log the results of rule execution without
blocking any requests.

We have an example test framework you can use to automatically test your rules.
Arcjet can also be triggered based using a sample of your traffic.

See the [Testing](/testing) section of the docs for details.
