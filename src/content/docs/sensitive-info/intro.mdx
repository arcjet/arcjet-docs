With Arcjet sensitive info you can prevent clients from sending you data that
you do not want to handle.

This rule runs entirely locally so no data ever leaves your environment.
You can block personally identifiable information (PII) such as email addresses,
card numbers,
IP addresses,
phone numbers,
or custom data types.

Sensitive info works on the request body.
To detect particular info in headers or other fields use
[Arcjet Filters][arcjet-filters].

## When to use

You can use Sensitive info protection to prevent clients from sending you
sensitive info to reduce your compliance burden.

You can use [Arcjet Email validation][arcjet-email-validation] to check email
addresses.

## How it works

Arcjet takes the body of requests and splits it into tokens (“words”).
These tokens are analyzed for builtin entities (such as card numbers and email
addresses) and with user-defined `detect` functions.
This runs locally within the WebAssembly bundled with SDKs.

The built in entities are:

- card numbers (such as `4242424242424242`)
- email addresses (such as `alice@example.com`)
- IP addresses (such as `127.0.0.1`)
- phone numbers (such as `+1 (555) 555-5555`)

{/* Note: no section on `characteristics`/`fingerprint` needed as this rule is local. */}

This rule works locally.
Arcjet reports decisions to your dashboard but no data is sent to the
Arcjet Cloud API.

## Availability

Sensitive info protection is available on paid plans.
