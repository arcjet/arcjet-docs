Arcjet Sensitive Information Detection protects against clients sending you
sensitive information such as PII that you do not wish to handle.

## What does Arcjet Sensitive Info do?

Arcjet's "block sensitive information" rule prevents detected sensitive
information from reaching your application. The rule runs entirely locally so
no data ever leaves your environment.

## What kinds of sensitive information can Arcjet detect?

Arcjet can detect multiple types of sensitive and personally identifiable
information (PII).

The built in types are:

- Email addresses
- Credit/debit card numbers
- IP addresses
- Phone numbers

In addition to these you can also use the custom detect function to implement
detection for other types.

## How is sensitive information detected?

Arcjet takes the body of your request and analyzes it for the configured
sensitive information types. This is performed using a WebAssembly module loaded
by the SDK so that the analysis happens in a secure sandbox entirely within your
environment.

The analysis determines whether or not the request is a string, if it is then we
convert the string to tokens by splitting it on whitespace and trimming
punctuation marks such as commas, apostrophes and quotes.

Once we have converted it to tokens we provide them to the any configured custom
detect function, if provided. If it detects any sensitive information types then
those are returned, if not then we run Arcjet's built-in parsers to detect any
other types.

If the rules match any of the detected sensitive information types then the SDK
will return a block or allow decision based on the rule's configuration.

## Is any data sent to the cloud?

No, all sensitive information detection is performed locally within your own
environment. Arcjet reports the result to your dashboard, but does not send any
data to the cloud.
