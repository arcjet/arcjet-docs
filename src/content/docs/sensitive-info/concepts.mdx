Arcjet Sensitive Information Detection protects against clients sending you
sensitive information that you do not wish to handle.

## What does Arcjet Sensitive Info do?

Arcjet's block sensitive information rule prevents unexpected detected sensitive information
from reaching your application. The rule runs entirely locally so that you don't
unintentially send your user's sensitive data to us.

## What kinds of sensitive information can Arcjet detect?

Arcjet has implemented a number of built-in sensitive information detectors. In addition
to these you can also use the custom detect function to implement detection for other types.

The built in types are:

- Email addresses
- Credit/debit card numbers
- IP addresses
- Phone numbers

## How is sensitive information detected?

Arcjet takes the body of your request and sends it to our Arcjet Analyze wasm component.
Once its there we determine whether or not the request is a string, if it is then we
convert the string in to tokens by splitting it on whitespace and trimming punctuation
marks such as commas, apostrophes and quotes.

Once we have converted it to tokens we provide them to the user's custom detect function
if they provided one. If it detects any sensitive information types then those are returned,
if not then we run our built-in parsers to detect any other types.

The lists of detected sensitive information types are then sent back to our SDK which
produces a block or allow decision based on the rule's configuration and the types of
information that was detected.
