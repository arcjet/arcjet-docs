## Common problems

### Multiple decisions for the same request

If you are seeing multiple decisions for the same request, it is likely that
Arcjet is running in multiple places in your application. This can happen if you
are using a middleware and also calling the Arcjet SDK in a route handler.

You can fix this by ensuring that Arcjet is only called once per request. You
can combine multiple rules into a single client configuration and/or you can
exclude routes from your middleware.

## Common errors

### [unauthenticated] invalid key

```text
✦Aj Encountered problem getting remote decision: [unauthenticated] invalid key
```

This error means that the Arcjet key you are using is invalid. Each site has a
unique key to identify it within Arcjet. You can find your key in the Arcjet
dashboard by clicking your site name and then going to the SDK installation tab.

Arcjet keys are always prefixed with `ajkey_`

You provide the Arcjet SDK with the key when instantiating the client. For
example in this case the key is defined in an environment variable called
`ARCJET_KEY`:

```ts "process.env.ARCJET_KEY"
import arcjet from "arcjet";

const aj = arcjet({
  // Get your site key from https://app.arcjet.com
  // and set it as an environment variable rather than hard coding.
  // See: https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv
  key: process.env.ARCJET_KEY,
  rules: [
    // Protect against common attacks with Arcjet Shield
    shield({
      mode: "LIVE", // will block requests. Use "DRY_RUN" to log only
    }),
  ],
});
```

### [deadline_exceeded] the operation timed out

```text
✦Aj Encountered problem getting remote decision: [deadline_exceeded] the operation timed out
ConnectError: [deadline_exceeded] the operation timed out
```

This error means that the Arcjet SDK was unable to connect to the Arcjet API
within the short timeout period. This is usually caused by a network issue. The
SDK is designed to fail open so that in the event of a network problem or
outage, requests will be allowed.

If you are seeing this error frequently, please [contact us](/support) so we can
investigate.

### generateFingerprint: ip is empty / [failed_precondition] client IP not provided

Arcjet normally detects when it is running in a local environment and uses a
default IP address of `127.0.0.1`. However, if it can't determine whether it is
running locally or not then it will be safe and assume it is running in
production. In production environments we disallow private/internal addresses,
but they are allowed in development to allow you to test locally.

You can force the SDK to run in development mode by setting the environment
variable `ARCJET_ENV` to `development` in your `.env.local` file:

```ini title=".env.local"
ARCJET_ENV=development
```

Arcjet uses the client IP address as part of a fingerprint to identify where
each request is coming from. If the IP address is not provided, or it is running
in production and a private/internal address is provided, then Arcjet will show
this error.

### [failed_precondition] request details failed validation

Arcjet expects certain fields to exist on the object used to analyze each
request. This is normally handled by the SDK for the framework you are using,
but if you are doing something custom then you will need to provide the correct
fields:

The required fields are:

- `ip` - The client IP address. Internally our SDKs use our [`@arcjet/ip`
  package](https://github.com/arcjet/arcjet-js/tree/main/ip#example) to detect
  the correct IP which you can also use directly.
- `method` - The HTTP method of the request.
- `host` - The host of the request.
- `path` or `url` - The path of the request. In the Node.js SDK this field is
  called `url`. If you are not using an adapter, this is called `path`.
- `headers` - The headers of the request.

Here are some examples of how to provide these fields:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Node.js + Express">
    This example uses a Node.js + Express server using the Arcjet root package
    without an adapter. We do not recommend this approach as it requires you to
    manually provide the request. Instead, [use the Node.js
    adapter](/get-started/nodejs-express).
    <Code code={RequestFieldsExpressTS} lang="ts" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Node.js">
    This example uses a pure Node.js server using the Arcjet root package
    without an adapter. We do not recommend this approach as it requires you to
    manually provide the request. Instead, [use the Node.js
    adapter](/get-started/nodejs-express).
    <Code code={RequestFieldsTS} lang="ts" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Hono + Node.js">
    This example uses the [Hono framework with
    Node.js](https://hono.dev/getting-started/nodejs). It requires a bit more
    manual setup until we officially support Hono, see
    [arcjet-js#477](https://github.com/arcjet/arcjet-js/issues/477).
    <Code code={RequestFieldsHonoNodeTS} lang="ts" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Property '[INTERNALS]' is missing in type

When using the Arcjet Next.js SDK you may see a warning in your editor like this:

```text
Argument of type x is not assignable to parameter of type 'NextMiddleware'.
  Types of parameters 'req' and 'request' are incompatible.
    Property '[INTERNALS]' is missing in type 'import(".../next/dist/server/web/spec-extension/request").NextRequest' but required in type 'import(".../next/dist/server/web/spec-extension/request").NextRequest'.ts(2345)
request.d.ts(7, 5): '[INTERNALS]' is declared here.
```

This is usually caused by a mismatch between the version of Next.js you are using
and the version of the Arcjet SDK. You have several options for fixing this:

1. Update the Arcjet SDK to the latest version and update your version of
   Next.js to the latest version. We try to keep the SDK up to date with the
   latest Next.js releases so they should generally match.
2. Add a [resolution
   override](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/configuring-npm/package-json#overrides)
   to your `package.json` to force the SDK to use the same version of Next.js.
   For example, if you are using Next.js 14.1.4 you can add this override to
   your `package.json` to force the Arcjet SDK to use the same version:

   ```json
   {
     "overrides": {
       "next": "14.1.4"
     }
   }
   ```

3. You can ignore the warning. The warning is just a TypeScript error and does
   not affect the runtime behavior of your application. You can add a comment on
   the line that is causing the error to ignore it: `// @ts-ignore`

### Calling `protect()` with no rules is deprecated

When using the Arcjet SDK you may see a warning like this:

```text
Calling `protect()` with no rules is deprecated. Did you mean to configure the Shield rule?
```

Prior to the JS SDK release `v1.0.0-alpha.12` we allowed empty rules and
automatically configured a Shield rule for you. From `v1.0.0-alpha.12` onwards
you must explicitly configure the Shield rule. This allows you to choose if you
want to block suspicious requests or not. We are maintaining the old behavior
for a while to give you time to update your code, which is why this is warning
you. Shield is still configured automatically but you should now migrate to
explicitly configuring it.

Check out the [Shield documentation](/shield/concepts) to learn how to configure
Shield rules. To restore the old behavior you can add a simple Shield rule:

```ts
import arcjet, { shield } from "@arcjet/next";

const aj = arcjet({
  // Get your site key from https://app.arcjet.com
  // and set it as an environment variable rather than hard coding.
  // See: https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables
  key: process.env.ARCJET_KEY,
  rules: [
    // Protect against common attacks with Arcjet Shield
    shield({
      mode: "LIVE", // will block requests. Use "DRY_RUN" to log only
    }),
  ],
});
```

### The current file is a CommonJS module whose imports will produce 'require' calls

When using the Arcjet SDK you may see a warning like this:

```text
The current file is a CommonJS module whose imports will produce 'require'
calls; however, the referenced file is an ECMAScript module and cannot be
imported with 'require'.
```

This warning is caused by a mismatch between the module system used by the
Arcjet SDK and the module system used by your application. The Arcjet SDK uses
ECMAScript modules (ESM) but your application is using CommonJS modules (CJS).

The Arcjet SDK does not support CJS. You can fix this by changing your
application to use ESM. This is usually done by adding `"type": "module"` to
your `package.json`.

Alternatively, you can rename the files where you are using the Arcjet SDK to use
the `.mjs` or `.mts` extension. This will tell Node.js to treat the file as an
ESM file.

### Error: Log is required / Error: Client is required

You may see an error like this:

```text
Error: Log is required
    at arcjet (/node_modules/arcjet/index.js:520:15)
...
Error: Client is required
    at arcjet (/node_modules/arcjet/index.js:526:15)
```

This error usually means that you are trying to use the base `arcjet` package
rather than an adapter. You probably meant to use the `@arcjet/node` package
instead.

The `arcjet` package is a low-level package that is used to build adapters for
different [frameworks and runtimes we support](/get-started). Unless you are
doing something custom, we recommend using one of the adapters.

### Body already read

This happens when you try to access the request body after it has already been
processed by an Arcjet Sensitive Info rule. To fix this, you need to parse the
body before calling `protect`.

See the example in the [Accessing the
body](/sensitive-info/reference/nodejs#accessing-the-body) section.
