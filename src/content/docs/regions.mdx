Arcjet's API minimizes latency by running as close as possible to your application and routing requests based on the lowest latency region.

## New regions

We deploy regions based on demand, so if you need a region that isn't listed below, [let us know](/support). We can usually deploy to a new region within a few days.

## Current regions
