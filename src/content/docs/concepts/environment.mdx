The following environment variables can be used to configure Arcjet:

| Environment variable | Example value   |
| -------------------- | --------------- |
| `ARCJET_BASE_URL`    | `"https://…"`   |
| `ARCJET_ENV`         | `"development"` |
| `ARCJET_KEY`         | `"ajkey_…"`     |
| `ARCJET_LOG_LEVEL`   | `"warn"`        |
| `NODE_ENV`           | `"development"` |

The following environment variables are also used in Arcjet,
but are set by hosting platforms and should not be set manually:

- `FIREBASE_CONFIG`
- `FLY_APP_NAME`
- `RENDER`
- `VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_SHA`
- `VERCEL`

## List of environment variables

<a name="arcjet-base-url" />

### `ARCJET_BASE_URL`

URL to Arcjet Cloud API
(default: `"https://fly.decide.arcjet.com"` on Fly,
`"https://decide.arcjet.com"` otherwise).
Should only be set if directed by Arcjet support.
See [Architecture: Cloud API][arcjet-architecture-cloud-api] for more info.

{/* TODO: `baseUrl` can also be passed in `RemoteClientOptions` of `createRemoteClient`, in which case there is no verification; document that somewhere and link to it from here. */}

<a name="arcjet-env" />

<a name="node-env" />

### `ARCJET_ENV`, `NODE_ENV`

Whether the app is running in development
(`"development" | "production"`, default: `"production"`).
Arcjet is in development mode if either of these fields is set to `"development"`
and production mode otherwise.
`NODE_ENV` is a convention used in Node.js apps.

In development, the timeout for connecting to Cloud API is increased.
In production, the timeout is quicker.
This is because in production your app typically runs close to an Arcjet server,
but in development your app may run on your local machine, far away from Arcjet
servers.
See [Architecture: API latency][arcjet-architecture-api-latency] for more info.

In production, an error is logged when no client IP is found.
In development, the local IP `127.0.0.1` is used as a fallback.
When the client IP is missing (or local),
geolocation and other IP lookup info will be empty.
In development, an `x-arcjet-ip` header can be used to overwrite the client IP.
This is because it’s useful to overwrite IPs for testing,
but in production headers cannot be trusted as they can be set by malicious
users.

{/* TODO: link to Client IP concept when that lands. */}

The Arcjet Astro SDK uses `ARCJET_ENV` and the value at `import.meta.env.MODE`
(from Vite) but does not use `NODE_ENV`.

<a name="arcjet-key" />

### `ARCJET_KEY`

Arcjet Cloud API key for your site (`string`).
In most cases, this variable name is a recommended convention.
This value is not read automatically, unlike other variables, but should be
retrieved manually from the environment and must be passed explicitly to
Arcjet SDKs.

You can find your site key in the [Arcjet dashboard][arcjet-app].
Select your site, select “SDK configuration”, then click to copy.

Arcjet keys are secrets that are always prefixed with `ajkey_`.
As this is a secret, do not commit it to source control or otherwise expose it!

This value is read automatically when using the Arcjet Astro SDK.

<a name="arcjet-log-level" />

### `ARCJET_LOG_LEVEL`

Log level to use (`"debug" | "error" | "info" | "warn"`, default: `"warn"`).
Setting for example `warn` will log warning _and_ error messages.
The order of log levels from most verbose to least verbose is `debug`, `info`,
`warn`, `error`.

<a name="firebase-config" />

<a name="fly-app-name" />

<a name="render" />

<a name="vercel" />

### `FIREBASE_CONFIG`, `FLY_APP_NAME`, `RENDER`, `VERCEL`

Environment variables set by hosting platforms (`string`).
These should not be set in `.env` files but are set automatically by the
platforms where your app runs.
Arcjet checks whether values are non-empty.

[`FIREBASE_CONFIG`][google-firebase-config] is set by Firebase,
[`FLY_APP_NAME`][fly-app-name] is set by Fly,
[`RENDER`][render-render] is set by Render, and
[`VERCEL`][vercel-vercel] is set by Vercel.

The inferred platform affects which request headers are trusted when determining the
client IP.
When Fly is detected, that affects the default value of `ARCJET_BASE_URL`.

{/* TODO: link to Client IP concept when that lands. */}

<a name="vercel-git-commit-sha" />

### `VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_SHA`

Git SHA of the commit the deployment was triggered by (`string`).
This should not be set in `.env` files but
[`VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_SHA`][vercel-git-commit-sha] is automatically
set by Vercel.
When present in the Arcjet Next.js SDK,
its value is sent to Arcjet Cloud API as part of the `extra` fields,
which are displayed in the [Arcjet dashboard][arcjet-app].

## `.env` files

Arcjet recommends using `.env` files in development to set environment
variables.
It is also recommended to put `ARCJET_KEY`s in `.env` files.
As that is a secret, do not commit `.env` files to source control.

Whether `.env` files are loaded automatically depends on the framework or
runtime.
You can typically use an `--env-file` flag or similar to load `.env` files
explicitly.

In production it is recommended to set environment variables using the
dashboard provided by the platform where your app runs,
and not to use `.env` files.
