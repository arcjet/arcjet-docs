Arcjet can protect your [Better Auth](https://authjs.dev/) routes from brute
force attacks, signup spam and other abuse. You can also use the authenticated
user ID to implement user-specific rate limits.

## Example app

See an [example Next.js + Better Auth implementation on
GitHub](https://github.com/arcjet/arcjet-js/tree/main/examples/nextjs-better-auth).

## Better Auth hook

We recommend integrating Arcjet as a [hook](hook) in your Better Auth `auth.ts`
file because this allows you to easily intercept different actions e.g. signups
vs logins, but Arcjet can also be used in the route handler.

### Example

This example configures Arcjet with a base Shield rule which rules on every
request. Signup requests are processed with a signup form protection rule if
there is an email detected, otherwise a bot detection and sliding rate limit are
applied. For all other requests, bot detection is applied.

The Better Auth configuration uses GitHub and a SQLite database for the example,
but can be replaced with any other provider.
