Arcjet can protect your [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/) routes from brute
force attacks, signup spam and other abuse. You can also use the authenticated
user ID to implement user-specific rate limits.

## Example app

See an [example Next.js + Better Auth implementation on
GitHub](https://github.com/arcjet/arcjet-js/tree/main/examples/nextjs-better-auth).

## Better Auth hook

We recommend integrating Arcjet in the [auth route
handler](https://github.com/arcjet/arcjet-js/blob/main/examples/nextjs-better-auth/app/api/auth/%5B...all%5D/route.ts)
rather than a Better Auth Hook because hooks do not provide sufficient request
context in server-only environments.
