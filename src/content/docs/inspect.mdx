The Arcjet decision inspection library provides a set of utilities to more
easily interact with the decision returned from an Arcjet SDK.

import WhatAreArcjetUtilities from "@/components/WhatAreArcjetUtilities.astro";

<WhatAreArcjetUtilities />

## Why

In addition to providing an easy-to-consume security recommendation, each Arcjet
SDK also provides a lot of metadata attached to every decision. Users can use
all of these signals to inform application logic, but it can be quite verbose to
extract the information.

As we notice common patterns, we provide optional utilities in the
`@arcjet/inspect` package to streamline these operations.

## Install

```sh
npm install -S @arcjet/inspect
```

## Usage

import InspectUsage from "@/snippets/inspect/usage.ts?raw";

<Code code={InspectUsage} lang="ts" />

## API

import Free from "@/components/badges/Free.astro";

### `isSpoofedBot(result: ArcjetRuleResult)`

Determines if a non-`"DRY_RUN"` bot rule detected a spoofed request. If `true`,
the request was likely spoofed and you may want to block it.

For `allow` rules, Arcjet verifies the authenticity of detected bots by checking
IP data and performing reverse DNS lookups. This helps protect against spoofed
bots where malicious clients pretend to be a well-behaving bot.

Returns `true` if the bot rule result was not `"DRY_RUN"` and a spoofed bot was
detected, `false` if the bot rule result was not `"DRY_RUN"` and a spoofed bot
was not detected, or `undefined` if the rule result was from a `"DRY_RUN"` bot
rule or a non-bot rule.

:::note Spoofed bot detection is not available on <Free /> plans. :::

**Types:**

<DisplayType type="ArcjetRuleResult" from="@arcjet/protocol" />

### `isVerifiedBot(result: ArcjetRuleResult)`

Determines if a non-`"DRY_RUN"` bot rule detected a request from a verified bot.
If `true`, the bot was verified as legitimate and you may want to ignore other
signals.

For `allow` rules, Arcjet verifies the authenticity of detected bots by checking
IP data and performing reverse DNS lookups. A verified bot is a bot that has
passed these checks.

Returns `true` if the bot rule result was not `"DRY_RUN"` and a verified bot was
detected, `false` if the bot rule result was not `"DRY_RUN"` and a verified bot
was not detected, or `undefined` if the rule result was from a `"DRY_RUN"` bot
rule or a non-bot rule.

:::note Verified bot detection is not available on <Free /> plans. :::

**Types:**

<DisplayType type="ArcjetRuleResult" from="@arcjet/protocol" />

### `isMissingUserAgent(result: ArcjetRuleResult)`

Determines if a non-`"DRY_RUN"` bot rule errored due to a missing User-Agent
header on the request. If `true`, you may want to block the request because a
missing User-Agent header is a good indicator of a malicious request since it is
recommended by
[RFC9110](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110#field.user-agent).

Returns `true` if the rule result was not `"DRY_RUN"` and the request was
missing a User-Agent header, `false` if the rule result was not `"DRY_RUN"` and
the request had a User-Agent header, or `undefined` if the rule result was from
a `"DRY_RUN"` bot rule or a non-bot rule.

**Types:**

<DisplayType type="ArcjetRuleResult" from="@arcjet/protocol" />

## What next?

Arcjet can protect your entire app or individual routes with just a few lines of
code. Using the main Arcjet SDK you can setup bot protection, rate limiting for
your API, minimize fraudulent registrations with the signup form protection and
more.
