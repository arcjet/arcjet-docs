Our philosophy around major SDK version upgrades is to avoid breaking changes
where possible. When they are necessary, we will deprecate rather than break,
and provide a clear migration path that will remain supported for some time.

This page documents breaking changes and migrations between SDK releases.

## Arcjet JS SDK 1.0.0 beta 1

The
[`1.0.0-beta-1`](https://github.com/arcjet/arcjet-js/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.1)
version of the Arcjet JS SDK was released on 2025-01-15 and includes the
following breaking changes.

### `block` is now `deny` for `validateEmail` rules

When configuring the `validateEmail` rule we have renamed the `block` option to
`deny`. This follows the same API design as the other rules.

```ts
validateEmail({
  mode: "LIVE",
  // replace block with deny as shown
  // block: ["DISPOSABLE"],
  deny: ["DISPOSABLE"],
});
```

It is now also possible to configure email types to allow. In the example below,
only email addresses from free email providers will be allowed.

```ts
validateEmail({
  mode: "LIVE",
  allow: ["FREE"],
});
```

The old options will continue to work, but have been flagged as deprecated.

### `ArcjetEnum` objects are now deprecated

In earlier versions of the SDK we provided enum objects for configuring your
rules. These have been deprecated in favor of string-type enums.

The table below shows which enums you should replace and their equivalent
strings.

### Handling of url-encoded data in sensitive info detection

The [sensitive information detection](/sensitive-info/quick-start) and
[@arcjet/redact](/redact/quick-start) features now handle both raw and
URL-encoded data simultaneously. This dual processing approach ensures
comprehensive detection, particularly for content containing the + character,
which serves both as a literal plus sign (common in phone numbers) and as an
encoded space in URLs.

When implementing custom detection functions on data containing + characters,
you may observe duplicate token matches across different processing windows.
This occurs because the system analyzes the input in two ways:

- With `+` interpreted as a literal plus sign
- With `+` decoded as a space character

For example:

```txt
# Input: "phone+number+123"
# Processed as both:
# - "phone+number+123"
# - "phone number 123"
```

### Wasm loading has moved to `@arcjet/analyze-wasm`

We have moved the responsibility for loading Wasm on your target platform from
`@arcjet/analyze` to `@arcjet/analyze-wasm`. This should not affect users who
were using the SDK through the high level framework adapters e.g.
`@arcjet/next`.

## Arcjet JS SDK 1.0.0-alpha.24

The
[`1.0.0-alpha-24`](https://github.com/arcjet/arcjet-js/releases/tag/v1.0.0-alpha.24)
version of the Arcjet JS SDK was released on 2024-09-05 and includes the
following breaking changes.

### `add` and `remove` replaced with `allow` and `deny` in `detectBot` rule

Passing user agent patterns to the bot detection rules has been deprecated in
favor of specifying string-type enums to `allow` or `deny`.

To maintain the previous default behavior of denying all bots, you can configure
the following rule:

```ts
detectBot({
  mode: "LIVE",
  allow: [],
});
```

We now publish [a list of known bots](/bot-protection/identifying-bots) as both
individual user agents as well as categories of types of bots. You can use these
to configure your bot detection rules.

For example, a common configuration is to block all bots except search engine
crawlers:

```ts
detectBot({
  mode: "LIVE",
  // Block all bots except the following
  allow: [
    "CATEGORY:SEARCH_ENGINE", // Google, Bing, etc
    // Uncomment to allow these other common bot categories
    // See the full list at https://arcjet.com/bot-list
    //"CATEGORY:MONITOR", // Uptime monitoring services
    //"CATEGORY:PREVIEW", // Link previews e.g. Slack, Discord
  ],
}),
```
