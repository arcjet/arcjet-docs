Arcjet email validation lets you validate and verify email addresses in your
application to reduce spam and fraudulent signups.

<WhatIsArcjet />

Email validation is useful anywhere users enter an email address, such as
signup, login, password reset, and contact forms. It helps you catch invalid,
disposable, and undeliverable addresses before they become accounts in your
system.

Unlike using a simple library that only checks email syntax, Arcjet email
validation also verifies whether email addresses are disposable, can actually
receive email (MX records), and more - without you needing to run any
infrastructure.

## When to use Arcjet email validation

Use Arcjet email validation when you want to:

- Reduce spam and fraudulent accounts at signup.
- Improve data quality in user profiles and contact lists.
- Avoid sending email to invalid or undeliverable addresses.
- Block temporary / disposable email addresses.

You can combine email validation with
[Arcjet rate limiting][arcjet-rate-limiting] to prevent brute-force attacks,
and with [Arcjet sensitive info][arcjet-sensitive-info] to block unwanted or
unsafe data.

## How Arcjet email validation works

Arcjet validates email addresses in two stages: **local syntax validation** and
**remote verification**.

### 1. Local syntax validation

First, Arcjet validates the email address syntax. Validation follows several
email RFCs, with deliberate modifications to exclude addresses that don’t make
sense for real applications (for example, `localhost` domains).

These algorithms are shipped with the Arcjet SDKs.

Only syntactically valid email addresses are sent to the Arcjet Cloud API for
further verification.

### 2. Remote email verification

The Arcjet Cloud API performs additional checks for syntactically valid
addresses. This includes:

- **Email categorization** Whether the domain is disposable, free, or custom
  (for example, `gmail.com` is considered a free email service).

- **MX check**
  Whether the domain has valid MX records and appears able to receive email.

- **Gravatar check**
  Whether the address has a [Gravatar][] entry associated with it. This can be
  a useful signal that the email address belongs to a real person.

These checks help you decide whether to accept, reject, or flag an email
address in your application logic.
