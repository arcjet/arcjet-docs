Arcjet allows you to validate & verify an email address. This is useful for
preventing users from signing up with fake email addresses and can significantly
reduce the amount of spam or fraudulent accounts.

## Plan availability

Arcjet email validation availability depends depends on your [pricing
plan](https://arcjet.com/pricing).

| Plan                                                                             | Email validation                                       |

## Configuration

Email validation is configured by specifying the email types you wish to allow
or deny, and whether you wish to modify certain validation options.

The `arcjet` client can be configured with one or more Email validation rules,
which are constructed with the `validateEmail(options: EmailOptions)` function
and configured by `EmailOptions`:

<DisplayType type="EmailOptions" from="arcjet" />
<DisplayType type="ArcjetMode" from="arcjet" />
<DisplayType type="ArcjetEmailType" from="arcjet" />

<Aside type="note">
  When specifying multiple rules, the order of the rules is ignored. Rule
  execution ordering is automatically optimized for performance. See
  [decision](#decision) below for details of examining the execution results.
</Aside>

The `allow`and `deny` lists are mutually-exclusive, such that using `allow` will
result in a `DENY` decision for any email type that is not specified in the
`allow` list and using `deny` will result in an `ALLOW` decision for any email
type that is not specified in the `deny` list.

The validation options can usually be left as the defaults. However, if you wish
to allow certain types of email addresses, you can modify the options:

- `requireTopLevelDomain`: Whether or not to allow email addresses that don't
  contain at least 2 domain segments (the domain name and TLD). Defaults to
  `true`. Changing to `false` means that `foo@bar` would be allowed.
- `allowDomainLiteral`: Whether or not to allow email addresses with domain
  literals. Defaults to `false`. Changing to `true` means that
  `foo@[123.456.789.0]` would be allowed.

  <NextJsPagesServerActions slot="next-js" />
</SlotByFramework>

## Decision

Arcjet provides a single `protect` function that is used to execute your
protection rules. This requires a `request` argument which is the request
context as passed to the request handler. When configured with a `validateEmail`
rule it also requires an additional `email` prop.

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <NestJsGuardDecision slot="nest-js" />
</SlotByFramework>

This function returns a `Promise` that resolves to an
`ArcjetDecision` object. This contains the following properties:

- `id` (`string`) - The unique ID for the request. This can be used to look up
  the request in the Arcjet dashboard. It is prefixed with `req_` for decisions
  involving the Arcjet cloud API. For decisions taken locally, the prefix is
  `lreq_`.
- `conclusion` (`ArcjetConclusion`) - The final conclusion based on evaluating
  each of the configured rules. If you wish to accept Arcjet's recommended
  action based on the configured rules then you can use this property.
- `reason` (`ArcjetReason`) - An object containing more detailed
  information about the conclusion.
- `results` (`ArcjetRuleResult[]`) - An array of `ArcjetRuleResult` objects
  containing the results of each rule that was executed.
- `ip` (`ArcjetIpDetails`) - An object containing Arcjet's analysis of the
  client IP address. See the SDK reference for more information.

You check if a deny conclusion has been returned by an email validation rule by
using `decision.isDenied()` and `decision.reason.isEmail()`.

You can iterate through the results and check whether an email validation rule
was applied:

```ts
for (const result of decision.results) {
  console.log("Rule Result", result);
}
```

This example will log the full result as well as the email validation rule:

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <DecisionLogDenyBun slot="bun" />
  <DecisionLogDenyNestJs slot="nest-js" />
  <DecisionLogDenyNextJs slot="next-js" />
  <DecisionLogDenyNodeJs slot="node-js" />
  <DecisionLogDenyRemix slot="remix" />
  <DecisionLogDenySvelteKit slot="sveltekit" />
</SlotByFramework>

## Allowing specific email types

In addition to being able to deny specific email types, you can also configure
Arcjet to only allow specific email types and all other types will be blocked.

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <DecisionLogAllowBun slot="bun" />
  <DecisionLogAllowNestJs slot="nest-js" />
  <DecisionLogAllowNextJs slot="next-js" />
  <DecisionLogAllowNodeJs slot="node-js" />
  <DecisionLogAllowRemix slot="remix" />
  <DecisionLogAllowSvelteKit slot="sveltekit" />
</SlotByFramework>

## Checking the email type

Arcjet will return the type of email address that was verified. This will be one
or several of the [reported email types](/email-validation/concepts#email-types).

```ts
// See https://docs.arcjet.com/email-validation/concepts#email-types
type ArcjetEmailType =
  | "DISPOSABLE" // Disposable email address from a throwaway email service
  | "FREE" // Email address from a free email service
  | "NO_MX_RECORDS" // Email address with no MX records i.e. is undeliverable
  | "NO_GRAVATAR" // Email address with no Gravatar profile
  | "INVALID"; // Email address that is invalid
```

You can check the email type using the `decision.reason.emailTypes` array:

```ts
let message = "";
// You could return specific messages based on the email type, but this would
// also reveal the validation to a spammer
if (decision.reason.emailTypes.includes("DISPOSABLE")) {
  message = "We do not allow disposable email addresses.";
} else if (decision.reason.emailTypes.includes("FREE")) {
  message =
    "We do not allow free email addresses, please use a business address.";
} else if (decision.reason.emailTypes.includes("NO_MX_RECORDS")) {
  message = "Your email domain does not have an MX record. Is there a typo?";
} else if (decision.reason.emailTypes.includes("NO_GRAVATAR")) {
  message = "We require a Gravatar profile to sign up.";
} else {
  // This is a catch all
  message = "Invalid email.";
}
```

## Error handling

Arcjet is designed to fail open so that a service issue or misconfiguration does
not block all requests. The SDK will also time out and fail open after 1000ms
when `NODE_ENV` or `ARCJET_ENV` is `development` and 500ms otherwise. However,
in most cases, the response time will be less than 20-30ms.

If there is an error condition when processing the rule, Arcjet will return an
`ERROR` result for that rule and you can check the `message` property on the rule's
error result for more information.

If all other rules that were run returned an `ALLOW` result, then the final Arcjet
conclusion will be `ERROR`.

<SlotByFramework client:load>
  <ErrorsBun slot="bun" />
  <ErrorsNestJs slot="nest-js" />
  <ErrorsNextJs slot="next-js" />
  <ErrorsNodeJs slot="node-js" />
  <ErrorsRemix slot="remix" />
  <ErrorsSvelteKit slot="sveltekit" />
</SlotByFramework>

## Testing

Arcjet runs the same in any environment, including locally and in CI. You can
use the `mode` set to `DRY_RUN` to log the results of rule execution without
blocking any requests.

We have an example test framework you can use to automatically test your rules.
Arcjet can also be triggered based using a sample of your traffic.

See the [Testing](/testing) section of the docs for details.
