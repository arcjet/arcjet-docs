With Arcjet Email validation you can validate and verify email addresses.

Email validation is useful to reduce the amount of spam and fraudulent accounts
on your platform.

With other packages you can validate that email addresses are syntactically
correct too.
With Arcjet you can also verify that email addresses are disposable,
cannot receive email (no MX records),
and more,
without needing to set up any infrastructure.

## When to use

You can use Email validation to reduce spam or fraudulent accounts.

You can combine this with [Arcjet Rate limiting][arcjet-rate-limiting] to
prevent brute force attacks
or [Arcjet Sensitive info][arcjet-sensitive-info] to block unwanted data.

## How it works

Arcjet validates the email address syntax.
Validation follows several RFCs with modifications to exclude addresses such as
localhost domains that don’t make sense for signing up to a real application.
These algorithms are shipped locally within the WebAssembly bundled with SDKs.
This code is like the [`johnstonskj/rust-email_address`][github-email-address]
crate.

The Arcjet Cloud API verifies addresses that are syntactically valid.
This includes:

- **email categorization**
  — whether the domain is a disposable or free
- **MX check**
  — whether the domain has valid MX records for receiving email
- **Gravatar check**
  — whether the address has a [Gravatar][] entry associated with it;
  useful for checking if the email address is a real person

{/* Note: no section on `characteristics`/`fingerprint` needed as email rules are not cached. */}

## Availability

Validation is available on all plans.
Advanced verification is available on paid plans.
