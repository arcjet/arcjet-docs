Arcjet allows you to validate & verify an email address. This is useful for
preventing users from signing up with fake email addresses and can significantly
reduce the amount of spam or fraudulent accounts.

## Step 1: Validation

The first step is to validate the email address syntax. This runs locally
within the SDK and validates the email address is in the correct format.
Validation is performed against several RFCs with modifications to exclude email
addresses you wouldn't expect signing up to a real application e.g. local
domains.

Two of the validation options are configurable: whether 2 parts of the domain
are required (defaults to being required) and whether domain literals in the
form of `example@[127.0.0.1]` are allowed (defaults to not being allowed).
Configuring these is described within the SDK documentation.

Internally, validation is implemented using the open source `email_address`
Crate.

### Validation errors

If an email address fails validation, one of the following errors will be
provided:

#### Configurable

- `MissingTopLevelDomain`: The email address didn't contain at least 2 domain
  segments â€” it must contain at least the domain name and TLD.
- `InvalidDomainLiteral`: Domain literals (e.g. `foo@[123.456.789.0]`) are not
  supported but one was provided.

#### Non-configurable

- `MissingSeparator`: The `@` character was missing between the local part and
  domain.
- `InvalidCharacter`: The email address contained an invalid character.
- `LocalPartEmpty`: The local part of the email address must contain at least 1
  character.
- `LocalPartTooLong` The local part has a max-length of 64 characters, as per
  [RFC3696](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3696#section-3)
- `DomainEmpty`: The domain of the email address must contain at least 1
  character.
- `DomainTooLong`: The domain has a max-length of 254 characters, as per
  [RFC3696 errata
  1690](https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata_search.php?rfc=3696&eid=1690)
- `SubDomainEmpty` One or more domain segments, separated by the `.` character,
  are empty.
- `SubDomainTooLong` One or more domain segments, separated by the `.`
  character, are longer than 63 characters, as per
  [RFC1034](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1034#section-3.5)

## Step 2: Verification

If the email syntax is valid, the SDK will pass the email address to the Arcjet
cloud API to verify the email address. This performs several checks:

- MX validation: Checks if the domain has valid MX records.
- Email type: Checks if the email address is a free, disposable or role-based
  email address.
- Has Gravatar: Checks if the email address has a
  [Gravatar](https://gravatar.com) image associated with it. This is useful for
  checking if the email address is a real person.

This metadata is returned as part of the Arcjet SDK response so you can decide
what to do next. For example, you might decide to block signups from domains
without MX records and from disposable email addresses, but add a flag to
manually review those from free email providers.

### Email types

The Arcjet SDK will provide an analysis of the email type, returning one or
several of the following:

- **Disposable:** The email address is disposable, which means it's registered to a
  service that allows throwaway email addresses. Although these are sometimes
  used for privacy, they are also often used for spam signups or fraudulent
  activity when combined with a transaction e.g. attempting to use a credit
  card. We recommend blocking these in higher risk scenarios.
- **Free:** The email address is registered to a free email service. These are very
  common, such as GMail or Yahoo Mail, so we do not recommend blocking these.
  However, you may wish to flag these for review the first time they attempt a
  transaction.
- **No MX records:** This email address is registered to a domain name which has
  no MX records configured. This means it cannot receive email. We recommend
  blocking these.
- **No Gravatar**: This email has no Gravatar attached to the email from which
  makes it slightly less likely to be a valid signup. This can be used for your
  own risk scoring or to trigger a manual review.
