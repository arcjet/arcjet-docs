Arcjet allows you validate & verify an email address. This is useful for
preventing users from signing up with fake email addresses and can significantly
reduce the amount of spam or fraudulent accounts.

## Configuration

Email validation is configured by specifying the email types you wish to block
and whether you wish to modify certain validation options.

The configuration definition is:

```ts
type EmailOptions = {
  mode?: "LIVE" | "DRY_RUN";
  block?: ArcjetEmailType[];
  requireTopLevelDomain?: boolean; // default: true
  allowDomainLiteral?: boolean; // default: false
};
```

The `arcjet` client is configured with one or many `validateEmail` rules which
take `EmailOptions`.

<Aside type="note">
  When specifying multiple rules, the order of the rules is ignored. Rule
  execution ordering is automatically optimized for performance. See
  [decision](#decision) below for details of examining the execution results.
</Aside>

Which email types to block is configured by listing the types in the
configuration block.

The validation options can usually be left as the defaults. However, if you wish
to allow certain types of email addresses, you can modify the options:

- `requireTopLevelDomain`: Whether or not to allow email addresses that don't
  contain at least 2 domain segments (the domain name and TLD). Defaults to
  `true`. Changing to `false` means that `foo@bar` would be allowed.
- `allowDomainLiteral`: Whether or not to allow email addresses with domain
  literals. Defaults to `false`. Changing to `true` means that
  `foo@[123.456.789.0]` would be allowed.

### Server actions

See our [example in the SDK reference](/reference/nextjs#server-actions).

## Decision

Arcjet provides a single `protect` function that is used to execute your
protection rules. This requires a `request` argument which is the request
context as passed to the request handler. When configured with a `validateEmail`
rule it also requires an additional `email` prop.

This function returns a `Promise` that resolves to an
`ArcjetDecision` object. This contains the following properties:

- `id` (`string`) - The unique ID for the request. This can be used to look up
  the request in the Arcjet dashboard. It is prefixed with `req_` for decisions
  involving the Arcjet cloud API. For decisions taken locally, the prefix is
  `lreq_`.
- `conclusion` (`ArcjetConclusion`) - The final conclusion based on evaluating
  each of the configured rules. If you wish to accept Arcjet's recommended
  action based on the configured rules then you can use this property.
- `reason` (`ArcjetReason`) - An object containing more detailed
  information about the conclusion.
- `results` (`ArcjetRuleResult[]`) - An array of `ArcjetRuleResult` objects
  containing the results of each rule that was executed.
- `ip` (`ArcjetIpDetails`) - An object containing Arcjet's analysis of the
  client IP address. See [IP analysis](/reference/nextjs/#ip-analysis) in the
  SDK reference for more information.

See [the SDK reference](/reference/nextjs#results) for more details about the
rule results.

You check if a deny conclusion has been returned by an email validation rule by
using `decision.isDenied()` and `decision.reason.isEmail()`.

You can iterate through the results and check whether an email validation rule
was applied:

```ts
for (const result of decision.results) {
  console.log("Rule Result", result);
}
```

This example will log the full result as well as the email validation rule:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="TS (App)">
Create a new API route at `/app/api/route/hello.ts`:

<Code code={DecisionLogAppTS} title="/app/api/route/hello.ts" lang="ts" />

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="TS (Pages)">
Create a new API route at `/pages/api/hello.ts`:

<Code code={DecisionLogPagesTS} title="/pages/api/hello.ts" lang="ts" />

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="JS (App Router)">
Create a new API route at `/app/api/arcjet/route.js`:

<Code code={DecisionLogAppJS} title="/app/api/route/hello.js" lang="js" />

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="JS (Pages Router)">
Create a new API route at `/pages/api/arcjet.js`:

<Code code={DecisionLogPagesJS} title="/pages/api/hello.js" lang="js" />

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Checking the email type

Arcjet will return the type of email address that was verified. This will be one
or several of the [reported email types](/email-validation/concepts#email-types).

```ts
// See https://docs.arcjet.com/email-validation/concepts#email-types
type ArcjetEmailType =
  | "DISPOSABLE" // Disposable email address from a throwaway email service
  | "FREE" // Email address from a free email service
  | "NO_MX_RECORDS" // Email address with no MX records i.e. is undeliverable
  | "NO_GRAVATAR" // Email address with no Gravatar profile
  | "INVALID"; // Email address that is invalid
```

## Error handling

Arcjet is designed to fail open so that a service issue or misconfiguration does
not block all requests. The SDK will also time out and fail open after 1000ms
when `NODE_ENV` or `ARCJET_ENV` is `development` and 500ms otherwise. However,
in most cases, the response time will be less than 20-30ms.

If there is an error condition, Arcjet will return an `ERROR` `conclusion`.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="TS (App)">
<Code code={ErrorsAppTS} title="/app/api/hello/route.ts" lang="ts" />

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="TS (Pages)">
<Code code={ErrorsPagesTS} title="/pages/hello/route.ts" lang="ts" />

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="JS (App Router)">
<Code code={ErrorsAppJS} title="/app/api/hello/route.js" lang="js" />

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="JS (Pages Router)">
<Code code={ErrorsPagesJS} title="/pages/api/hello.js" lang="js" />

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Edge Functions

Arcjet works in Edge Functions and with the [Edge
Runtime](https://edge-runtime.vercel.app/).

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="TS (App)">
<Code code={EdgeAppTS} title="/app/api/hello/route.ts" lang="ts" />

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="TS (Pages)">
<Code code={EdgePagesTS} title="/pages/hello/route.ts" lang="ts" />

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="JS (App Router)">
<Code code={EdgeAppJS} title="/app/api/hello/route.js" lang="js" />

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="JS (Pages Router)">
<Code code={EdgePagesJS} title="/pages/api/hello.js" lang="js" />

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Testing

Arcjet runs the same in any environment, including locally and in CI. You can
use the `mode` set to `DRY_RUN` to log the results of rule execution without
blocking any requests.

We have an example test framework you can use to automatically test your rules.
Arcjet can also be triggered based using a sample of your traffic.

See the [Testing](/testing) section of the docs for details.
