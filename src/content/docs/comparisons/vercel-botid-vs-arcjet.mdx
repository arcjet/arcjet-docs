Arcjet is an alternative to [Vercel BotID](https://vercel.com/botid) for
protecting your applications from bots. Both products offer bot detection and
mitigation features, but there are some key differences to consider when
choosing between them.

## Key differences: Vercel BotID vs Arcjet

1. **Security platform**: Arcjet is a comprehensive security platform that
   offers a wide range of protections including
   [bot detection](/bot-protection/intro),
   [rate limiting](/rate-limiting/intro),
   [email validation](/email-validation/intro),
   [sensitive info detection](/sensitive-info/intro),
   [shield WAF](/shield/intro) (web application firewall),
   and more. Vercel BotID is primarily focused on
   bot detection and mitigation. Vercel's broader platform services include
   [WAF](https://vercel.com/docs/vercel-firewall/vercel-waf) and [rate
   limiting](https://vercel.com/docs/vercel-firewall/vercel-waf/rate-limiting),
   but they are separate from BotID and must be configured independently.
2. **Integration**: Arcjet is designed to integrate directly into your codebase,
   allowing you to customize protections for different parts of your
   application. Vercel BotID is primarily designed as a wrapper around your
   Next.js application in the [instrumentation
   client](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/instrumentation-client)
   or within specific event handlers for other frameworks. Protected paths must
   be configured separately from the code for BotID whereas Arcjet configuration
   happens in code. Vercel's BotID [doesn't work with traditional HTML
   forms](https://vercel.com/docs/botid/form-submissions) whereas Arcjet can
   protect any type of request handler.
3. **Platform independence**: Arcjet is platform-agnostic and can be used with
   any hosting provider or framework. Vercel BotID only works for applications
   hosted on Vercel.
4. **Developer experience**: Arcjet is called like any other library from your
   codebase and provides a response with detailed analysis of each request.
   Rules are just code so can be varied dynamically based on request context
   e.g. changing rate limits based on user subscription level or allowing /
   denying certain bots based on the type of traffic you expect. Results can be
   inspected to understand the decision and customize the response. Vercel BotID
   provides few configuration options and returns only minimal information about
   the request.

## When to choose which

- **Choose Arcjet** if you want security independence regardless of where you
  deploy, need native form support, want rules-as-code with inspectable
  decisions, want to be able to test locally with the same behavior as
  production or want bot protection next to rate limiting, email validation,
  WAF, PII detection, and other security rules in one SDK.
- **Choose BotID** if you're fully on Vercel, want a quick boolean bot check,
  don't need to make any customizations, and are fine configuring rate
  limits/WAF separately in the Vercel Firewall.

## FAQs

### Does BotID work without Vercel?

No. Vercel BotID requires hosting on Vercel to function. Arcjet is
platform-agnostic and can be used with any hosting provider or framework,
including running locally.

### Can I configure which bots to allow or block?

With Arcjet, you can [customize which bots to allow or
block](/bot-protection/identifying-bots) based on your application's needs. You
can allow well-known good bots by name (e.g., Googlebot) and category (e.g.
search engines) while blocking malicious ones.

Vercel BotID does not provide configuration options to choose which bots to
allow or deny - you only get the details of which bots were detected afterwards.

For example, this Arcjet configuration allows search engine bots but blocks all others:

```ts
const aj = arcjet({
  key: process.env.ARCJET_KEY!, // Get your site key from https://app.arcjet.com
  rules: [
    // Create a bot detection rule
    detectBot({
      mode: "LIVE", // Blocks requests. Use "DRY_RUN" to log only
      // Block all bots except the following
      allow: [
        "CATEGORY:SEARCH_ENGINE", // Google, Bing, etc
        // Uncomment to allow these other common bot categories
        // See the full list at https://arcjet.com/bot-list
        //"CATEGORY:MONITOR", // Uptime monitoring services
        //"CATEGORY:PREVIEW", // Link previews e.g. Slack, Discord
      ],
    }),
  ],
});
```

Arcjet can then be called from within any request handler and the results inspected:

```ts
export async function GET(req: Request) {
  const decision = await aj.protect(req);

  if (decision.isDenied()) {
    if (decision.reason.isBot()) {
      return NextResponse.json(
        { error: "No bots allowed", reason: decision.reason },
        { status: 403 },
      );
    } else {
      return NextResponse.json(
        { error: "Forbidden", reason: decision.reason },
        { status: 403 },
      );
    }
  }

  if (decision.ip.isVpn()) {
    return NextResponse.json(
      { error: "VPNs are not allowed" },
      { status: 403 },
    );
  }

  if (decision.ip.hasCountry() && decision.ip.country === "US") {
    // Return a custom response for the United States
    return NextResponse.json({ message: "Hello from the US!" });
  }

  return NextResponse.json({ message: "Hello world" });
}
```

Compare this to Vercel BotID where you can only inspect minimal details about the results:

```ts
import { checkBotId } from "botid/server";
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server";

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const botResult = await checkBotId();
  const { isBot, verifiedBotName, isVerifiedBot, verifiedBotCategory } =
    botResult;

  if (isBot) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: "Access denied" }, { status: 403 });
  }

  return NextResponse.json({ message: "Hello world" });
}
```
